A FIRST draft of this book was published in 1921 as a mathematical supplement to the French Edition of Space, Time and Gravitation.
During the ensuing eighteen months I have pursued my intention of
developing it into a more systematic and comprehensive treatise on
the mathematical theory of Relativity. The matter has been rewritten,
the sequence of the argument rearranged in many places, and numerous additions made throughout; so that the work is now expanded to
three times its former size. It is hoped that, as now enlarged, it may
meet the needs of those who wish to enter fully into these problems of
reconstruction of theoretical physics.
The reader is expected to have a general acquaintance with the less
technical discussion of the theory given in Space, Time and Gravitation, although there is not often occasion to make direct reference to it.
But it is eminently desirable to have a general grasp of the revolution
of thought associated with the theory of Relativity before approaching it along the narrow lines of strict mathematical deduction. In the
former work we explained how the older conceptions of physics had
become untenable, and traced the gradual ascent to the ideas which
must supplant them. Here our task is to formulate mathematically this
new conception of the world and to follow out the consequences to the
fullest extent.
The present widespread interest in the theory arose from the verification of certain minute deviations from Newtonian laws. To those who
preface vi
are still hesitating and reluctant to leave the old faith, these deviations
will remain the chief centre of interest; but for those who have caught
the spirit of the new ideas the observational predictions form only a
minor part of the subject. It is claimed for the theory that it leads to
an understanding of the world of physics clearer and more penetrating
than that previously attained, and it has been my aim to develop the
theory in a form which throws most light on the origin and significance
of the great laws of physics.
It is hoped that difficulties which are merely analytical have been
minimised by giving rather fully the intermediate steps in all the proofs
with abundant cross-references to the auxiliary formulae used.
For those who do not read the book consecutively attention may
be called to the following points in the notation. The summation convention (p. 80) is used. German letters always denote the product of
the corresponding English letter by √
−g (p. 188). h is the symbol
for “Hamiltonian differentiation” introduced on p. 234. An asterisk is
prefixed to symbols generalised so as to be independent of or covariant
with the gauge (p. 343).
A selected list of original papers on the subject is given in the Bibliography at the end, and many of these are sources (either directly or
at second-hand) of the developments here set forth. To fit these into a
continuous chain of deduction has involved considerable modifications
from their original form, so that it has not generally been found practicable to indicate the sources of the separate sections. A frequent cause
of deviation in treatment is the fact that in the view of most contemporary writers the Principle of Stationary Action is the final governing
law of the world; for reasons explained in the text I am unwilling to accord it so exalted a position. After the original papers of Einstein, and
those of de Sitter from which I first acquired an interest in the theory, I
am most indebted to Weyl’s Raum, Zeit, Materie. Weyl’s influence will
preface vii
be especially traced in §§ 49, 58, 59, 61, 63, as well as in the sections
referring to his own theory.
I am under great obligations to the officers and staff of the University
Press for their help and care in the intricate printing.

INTRODUCTION
The subject of this mathematical treatise is not pure mathematics
but physics. The vocabulary of the physicist comprises a number of
words such as length, angle, velocity, force, work, potential, current,
etc., which we shall call briefly “physical quantities.” Some of these
terms occur in pure mathematics also; in that subject they may have a
generalised meaning which does not concern us here. The pure mathematician deals with ideal quantities defined as having the properties
which he deliberately assigns to them. But in an experimental science
we have to discover properties not to assign them; and physical quantities are defined primarily according to the way in which we recognise
them when confronted by them in our observation of the world around
us.
Consider, for example, a length or distance between two points. It
is a numerical quantity associated with the two points; and we all know
the procedure followed in practice in assigning this numerical quantity
to two points in nature. A definition of distance will be obtained by
stating the exact procedure; that clearly must be the primary definition if we are to make sure of using the word in the sense familiar to
everybody. The pure mathematician proceeds differently; he defines
distance as an attribute of the two points which obeys certain laws—
the axioms of the geometry which he happens to have chosen—and he
is not concerned with the question how this “distance” would exhibit
itself in practical observation. So far as his own investigations are con-
introduction 2
cerned, he takes care to use the word self-consistently; but it does not
necessarily denote the thing which the rest of mankind are accustomed
to recognise as the distance of the two points.
To find out any physical quantity we perform certain practical operations followed by calculations; the operations are called experiments
or observations according as the conditions are more or less closely under our control. The physical quantity so discovered is primarily the
result of the operations and calculations; it is, so to speak, a manufactured article—manufactured by our operations. But the physicist is
not generally content to believe that the quantity he arrives at is something whose nature is inseparable from the kind of operations which
led to it; he has an idea that if he could become a god contemplating
the external world, he would see his manufactured physical quantity
forming a distinct feature of the picture. By finding that he can lay
x unit measuring-rods in a line between two points, he has manufactured the quantity x which he calls the distance between the points;
but he believes that that distance x is something already existing in
the picture of the world—a gulf which would be apprehended by a superior intelligence as existing in itself without reference to the notion
of operations with measuring-rods. Yet he makes curious and apparently illogical discriminations. The parallax of a star is found by a
well-known series of operations and calculations; the distance across
the room is found by operations with a tape-measure. Both parallax
and distance are quantities manufactured by our operations; but for
some reason we do not expect parallax to appear as a distinct element
in the true picture of nature in the same way that distance does. Or
again, instead of cutting short the astronomical calculations when we
reach the parallax, we might go on to take the cube of the result, and
so obtain another manufactured quantity, a “cubic parallax.” For some
obscure reason we expect to see distance appearing plainly as a gulf in
introduction 3
the true world-picture; parallax does not appear directly, though it can
be exhibited as an angle by a comparatively simple construction; and
cubic parallax is not in the picture at all. The physicist would say that
he finds a length, and manufactures a cubic parallax; but it is only
because he has inherited a preconceived theory of the world that he
makes the distinction. We shall venture to challenge this distinction.
Distance, parallax and cubic parallax have the same kind of potential existence even when the operations of measurement are not actually
made—if you will move sideways you will be able to determine the angular shift, if you will lay measuring-rods in a line to the object you
will be able to count their number. Any one of the three is an indication to us of some existent condition or relation in the world outside
us—a condition not created by our operations. But there seems no reason to conclude that this world-condition resembles distance any more
closely than it resembles parallax or cubic parallax. Indeed any notion
of “resemblance” between physical quantities and the world-conditions
underlying them seems to be inappropriate. If the length AB is double the length CD, the parallax of B from A is half the parallax of D
from C; there is undoubtedly some world-relation which is different for
AB and CD, but there is no reason to regard the world-relation of AB
as being better represented by double than by half the world-relation
of CD.
The connection of manufactured physical quantities with the existent world-condition can be expressed by saying that the physical quantities are measure-numbers of the world-condition. Measure-numbers
may be assigned according to any code, the only requirement being that
the same measure-number always indicates the same world-condition
and that different world-conditions receive different measure-numbers.
Two or more physical quantities may thus be measure-numbers of the
same world-condition, but in different codes, e.g. parallax and distance;
introduction 4
mass and energy; stellar magnitude and luminosity. The constant formulae connecting these pairs of physical quantities give the relation between the respective codes. But in admitting that physical quantities
can be used as measure-numbers of world-conditions existing independently of our operations, we do not alter their status as manufactured
quantities. The same series of operations will naturally manufacture
the same result when world-conditions are the same, and different results when they are different. (Differences of world-conditions which do
not influence the results of experiment and observation are ipso facto
excluded from the domain of physical knowledge.) The size to which
a crystal grows may be a measure-number of the temperature of the
mother-liquor; but it is none the less a manufactured size, and we do
not conclude that the true nature of size is caloric.
The study of physical quantities, although they are the results of
our own operations (actual or potential), gives us some kind of knowledge of the world-conditions, since the same operations will give different results in different world-conditions. It seems that this indirect
knowledge is all that we can ever attain, and that it is only through its
influences on such operations that we can represent to ourselves a “condition of the world.” Any attempt to describe a condition of the world
otherwise is either mathematical symbolism or meaningless jargon. To
grasp a condition of the world as completely as it is in our power to
grasp it, we must have in our minds a symbol which comprehends at
the same time its influence on the results of all possible kinds of operations. Or, what comes to the same thing, we must contemplate its
measures according to all possible measure-codes—of course, without
confusing the different codes. It might well seem impossible to realise
so comprehensive an outlook; but we shall find that the mathematical
calculus of tensors does represent and deal with world-conditions precisely in this way. A tensor expresses simultaneously the whole group of
introduction 5
measure-numbers associated with any world-condition; and machinery
is provided for keeping the various codes distinct. For this reason the
somewhat difficult tensor calculus is not to be regarded as an evil necessity in this subject, which ought if possible to be replaced by simpler
analytical devices; our knowledge of conditions in the external world, as
it comes to us through observation and experiment, is precisely of the
kind which can be expressed by a tensor and not otherwise. And, just
as in arithmetic we can deal freely with a billion objects without trying
to visualise the enormous collection; so the tensor calculus enables us
to deal with the world-condition in the totality of its aspects without
attempting to picture it.
Having regard to this distinction between physical quantities and
world-conditions, we shall not define a physical quantity as though
it were a feature in the world-picture which had to be sought out.
A physical quantity is defined by the series of operations and calculations of which it is the result. The tendency to this kind of definition
had progressed far even in pre-relativity physics. Force had become
“mass×acceleration,” and was no longer an invisible agent in the worldpicture, at least so far as its definition was concerned. Mass is defined
by experiments on inertial properties, no longer as “quantity of matter.”
But for some terms the older kind of definition (or lack of definition)
has been obstinately adhered to; and for these the relativity theory
must find new definitions. In most cases there is no great difficulty in
framing them. We do not need to ask the physicist what conception
he attaches to “length”; we watch him measuring length, and frame
our definition according to the operations he performs. There may
sometimes be cases in which theory outruns experiment and requires
us to decide between two definitions, either of which would be consistent with present experimental practice; but usually we can foresee
which of them corresponds to the ideal which the experimentalist has
introduction 6
set before himself. For example, until recently the practical man was
never confronted with problems of non-Euclidean space, and it might be
suggested that he would be uncertain how to construct a straight line
when so confronted; but as a matter of fact he showed no hesitation,
and the eclipse observers measured without ambiguity the bending of
light from the “straight line.” The appropriate practical definition was
so obvious that there was never any danger of different people meaning
different loci by this term. Our guiding rule will be that a physical
quantity must be defined by prescribing operations and calculations
which will lead to an unambiguous result, and that due heed must be
paid to existing practice; the last clause should secure that everyone
uses the term to denote the same quantity, however much disagreement
there may be as to the conception attached to it.
When defined in this way, there can be no question as to whether
the operations give us the real physical quantity or whether some theoretical correction (not mentioned in the definition) is needed. The
physical quantity is the measure-number of a world-condition in some
code; we cannot assert that a code is right or wrong, or that a measurenumber is real or unreal; what we require is that the code should be
the accepted code, and the measure-number the number in current use.
For example, what is the real difference of time between two events at
distant places? The operation of determining time has been entrusted
to astronomers, who (perhaps for mistaken reasons) have elaborated a
regular procedure. If the times of the two events are found in accordance with this procedure, the difference must be the real difference of
time; the phrase has no other meaning. But there is a certain generalisation to be noticed. In cataloguing the operations of the astronomers,
so as to obtain a definition of time, we remark that one condition is adhered to in practice evidently from necessity and not from design—the
observer and his apparatus are placed on the earth and move with the
introduction 7
earth. This condition is so accidental and parochial that we are reluctant to insist on it in our definition of time; yet it so happens that the
motion of the apparatus makes an important difference in the measurement, and without this restriction the operations lead to no definite
result and cannot define anything. We adopt what seems to be the
commonsense solution of the difficulty. We decide that time is relative
to an observer ; that is to say, we admit that an observer on another
star, who carries out all the rest of the operations and calculations as
specified in our definition, is also measuring time—not our time, but a
time relative to himself. The same relativity affects the great majority
of elementary physical quantities∗
; the description of the operations is
insufficient to lead to a unique answer unless we arbitrarily prescribe a
particular motion of the observer and his apparatus.
In this example we have had a typical illustration of “relativity,”
the recognition of which has had far-reaching results revolutionising
the outlook of physics. Any operation of measurement involves a comparison between a measuring-appliance and the thing measured. Both
play an equal part in the comparison and are theoretically, and indeed
often practically, interchangeable; for example, the result of an observation with the meridian circle gives the right ascension of the star or
the error of the clock indifferently, and we can regard either the clock
or the star as the instrument or the object of measurement. Remembering that physical quantities are results of comparisons of this kind,
it is clear that they cannot be considered to belong solely to one partner in the comparison. It is true that we standardise the measuring
appliance as far as possible (the method of standardisation being explained or implied in the definition of the physical quantity) so that in
∗The most important exceptions are number (of discrete entities), action, and
entropy.
introduction 8
general the variability of the measurement can only indicate a variability of the object measured. To that extent there is no great practical
harm in regarding the measurement as belonging solely to the second
partner in the relation. But even so we have often puzzled ourselves
needlessly over paradoxes, which disappear when we realise that the
physical quantities are not properties of certain external objects but
are relations between these objects and something else. Moreover, we
have seen that the standardisation of the measuring-appliance is usually
left incomplete, as regards the specification of its motion; and rather
than complete it in a way which would be arbitrary and pernicious,
we prefer to recognise explicitly that our physical quantities belong not
solely to the objects measured but have reference also to the particular
frame of motion that we choose.
The principle of relativity goes still further. Even if the measuringappliances were standardised completely, the physical quantities would
still involve the properties of the constant standard. We have seen
that the world-condition or object which is surveyed can only be apprehended in our knowledge as the sum total of all the measurements
in which it can be concerned; any intrinsic property of the object must
appear as a uniformity or law in these measures. When one partner in
the comparison is fixed and the other partner varied widely, whatever
is common to all the measurements may be ascribed exclusively to the
first partner and regarded as an intrinsic property of it. Let us apply
this to the converse comparison; that is to say, keep the measuringappliance constant or standardised, and vary as widely as possible the
objects measured—or, in simpler terms, make a particular kind of measurement in all parts of the field. Intrinsic properties of the measuringappliance should appear as uniformities or laws in these measures. We
are familiar with several such uniformities; but we have not generally
recognised them as properties of the measuring-appliance. We have
introduction 9
called them laws of nature.
The development of physics is progressive, and as the theories of the
external world become crystallised, we often tend to replace the elementary physical quantities defined through operations of measurement by
theoretical quantities believed to have a more fundamental significance
in the external world. Thus the vis viva mv2
, which is immediately
determinable by experiment, becomes replaced by a generalised energy,
virtually defined by having the property of conservation; and our problem becomes inverted—we have not to discover the properties of a thing
which we have recognised in nature, but to discover how to recognise in
nature a thing whose properties we have assigned. This development
seems to be inevitable; but it has grave drawbacks especially when theories have to be reconstructed. Fuller knowledge may show that there
is nothing in nature having precisely the properties assigned; or it may
turn out that the thing having these properties has entirely lost its
importance when the new theoretical standpoint is adopted∗
.
When we decide to throw the older theories into the melting-pot and
make a clean start, it is best to relegate to the background terminology associated with special hypotheses of physics. Physical quantities
defined by operations of measurement are independent of theory, and
form the proper starting-point for any new theoretical development.
Now that we have explained how physical quantities are to be defined, the reader may be surprised that we do not proceed to give the
definitions of the leading physical quantities. But to catalogue all the
precautions and provisos in the operation of determining even so simple
∗We shall see in § 59 that this has happened in the case of energy. The deadhand of a superseded theory continues to embarrass us, because in this case the
recognised terminology still has implicit reference to it. This, however, is only a
slight drawback to set off against the many advantages obtained from the classical
generalisation of energy as a step towards the more complete theory.
introduction 10
a thing as length, is a task which we shirk. We might take refuge in the
statement that the task though laborious is straightforward, and that
the practical physicist knows the whole procedure without our writing
it down for him. But it is better to be more cautious. I should be puzzled to say off-hand what is the series of operations and calculations
involved in measuring a length of 10−15 cm.; nevertheless I shall refer to
such a length when necessary as though it were a quantity of which the
definition is obvious. We cannot be forever examining our foundations;
we look particularly to those places where it is reported to us that they
are insecure. I may be laying myself open to the charge that I am doing
the very thing I criticise in the older physics—-using terms that have no
definite observational meaning, and mingling with my physical quantities things which are not the results of any conceivable experimental
operation. I would reply—
By all means explore this criticism if you regard it as a promising
field of inquiry. I here assume that you will probably find me a justification for my 10−15 cm.; but you may find that there is an insurmountable
ambiguity in defining it. In the latter event you may be on the track of
something which will give a new insight into the fundamental nature of
the world. Indeed it has been suspected that the perplexities of quantum phenomena may arise from the tacit assumption that the notions
of length and duration, acquired primarily from experiences in which
the average effects of large numbers of quanta are involved, are applicable in the study of individual quanta. There may need to be much
more excavation before we have brought to light all that is of value
in this critical consideration of experimental knowledge. Meanwhile I
want to set before you the treasure which has already been unearthed
in this field.
CHAPTER I
ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES
1. Indeterminateness of the space-time frame.
It has been explained in the early chapters of Space, Time and Gravitation that observers with different motions use different reckonings of
space and time, and that no one of these reckonings is more fundamental than another. Our problem is to construct a method of description
of the world in which this indeterminateness of the space-time frame of
reference is formally recognised.
Prior to Einstein’s researches no doubt was entertained that there
existed a “true even-flowing time” which was unique and universal. The
moving observer, who adopts a time-reckoning different from the unique
true time, must have been deluded into accepting a fictitious time with
a fictitious space-reckoning modified to correspond. The compensating
behaviour of electromagnetic forces and of matter is so perfect that, so
far as present knowledge extends, there is no test which will distinguish
the true time from the fictitious. But since there are many fictitious
times and, according to this view, only one true time, some kind of
distinction is implied although its nature is not indicated.
Those who still insist on the existence of a unique “true time” generally rely on the possibility that the resources of experiment are not
yet exhausted and that some day a discriminating test may be found.
ch. i indeterminateness of the space-time frame 12
But the off-chance that a future generation may discover a significance
in our utterances is scarcely an excuse for making meaningless noises.
Thus in the phrase true time, “true” is an epithet whose meaning
has yet to be discovered. It is a blank label. We do not know what
is to be written on the label, nor to which of the apparently indistinguishable time-reckonings it ought to be attached. There is no way of
progress here. We return to firmer ground, and note that in the mass
of experimental knowledge which has accumulated, the words time and
space refer to one of the “fictitious” times and spaces—primarily that
adopted by an observer travelling with the earth, or with the sun—and
our theory will deal directly with these space-time frames of reference,
which are admittedly fictitious or, in the more usual phrase, relative to
an observer with particular motion.
The observers are studying the same external events, notwithstanding their different space-time frames. The space-time frame is therefore
something overlaid by the observer on the external world; the partitions representing his space and time reckonings are imaginary surfaces
drawn in the world like the lines of latitude and longitude drawn on the
earth. They do not follow the natural lines of structure of the world,
any more than the meridians follow the lines of geological structure of
the earth. Such a mesh-system is of great utility and convenience in
describing phenomena, and we shall continue to employ it; but we must
endeavour not to lose sight of its fictitious and arbitrary nature.
It is evident from experience that a four-fold mesh-system must be
used; and accordingly an event is located by four coordinates, generally
taken as x, y, z, t. To understand the significance of this location, we
first consider the simple case of two dimensions. If we describe the
points of a plane figure by their rectangular coordinates x, y, the description of the figure is complete and would enable anyone to construct
it; but it is also more than complete, because it specifies an arbitrary
ch. i indeterminateness of the space-time frame 13
element, the orientation, which is irrelevant to the intrinsic properties
of the figure and ought to be cast aside from a description of those
properties. Alternatively we can describe the figure by stating the distances between the various pairs of points in it; this description is also
complete, and it has the merit that it does not prescribe the orientation or contain anything else irrelevant to the intrinsic properties of the
figure. The drawback is that it is usually too cumbersome to use in
practice for any but the simplest figures.
Similarly our four coordinates x, y, z, t may be expected to contain
an arbitrary element, analogous to an orientation, which has nothing
to do with the properties of the configuration of events. A different set
of values of x, y, z, t may be chosen in which this arbitrary element
of the description is altered, but the configuration of events remains
unchanged. It is this arbitrariness in coordinate specification which
appears as the indeterminateness of the space-time frame. The other
method of description, by giving the distances between every pair of
events (or rather certain relations between pairs of events which are
analogous to distance), contains all that is relevant to the configuration
of events and nothing that is irrelevant. By adopting this latter method
we can strip away the arbitrary part of the description, leaving only that
which has an exact counterpart in the configuration of the external
world.
To put the contrast in another form, in our common outlook the idea
of position or location seems to be fundamental. From it we derive distance or extension as a subsidiary notion, which covers part but not all
of the conceptions which we associate with location. Position is looked
upon as the physical fact—a coincidence with what is vaguely conceived
of as an identifiable point of space—whereas distance is looked upon
as an abstraction or a computational result calculable when the positions are known. The view which we are going to adopt reverses this.
ch. i indeterminateness of the space-time frame 14
Extension (distance, interval) is now fundamental; and the location of
an object is a computational result summarising the physical fact that
it is at certain intervals from the other objects in the world. Any idea
contained in the concept location which is not expressible by reference
to distances from other objects, must be dismissed from our minds.
Our ultimate analysis of space leads us not to a “here” and a “there,”
but to an extension such as that which relates “here” and “there.” To
put the conclusion rather crudely—space is not a lot of points close
together; it is a lot of distances interlocked.
Accordingly our fundamental hypothesis is that—
Everything connected with location which enters into observational
knowledge—everything we can know about the configuration of events—
is contained in a relation of extension between pairs of events.
This relation is called the interval, and its measure is denoted by ds.
If we have a system S consisting of events A, B, C, D, . . . , and
a system S
0
consisting of events A0
, B0
, C
0
, D0
, . . . , then the fundamental hypothesis implies that the two systems will be exactly alike
observationally if, and only if, all pairs of corresponding intervals in
the two systems are equal, AB = A0B0
, AC = A0C
0
, . . . . In that case if
S and S
0 are material systems they will appear to us as precisely similar
bodies or mechanisms; or if S and S
0
correspond to the same material
body at different times, it will appear that the body has not undergone
any change detectable by observation. But the position, motion, or
orientation of the body may be different; that is a change detectable
by observation, not of the system S, but of a wider system comprising
S and surrounding bodies.
Again let the systems S and S
0 be abstract coordinate-frames of
reference, the events being the corners of the meshes; if all corresponding intervals in the two systems are equal, we shall recognise that the
coordinate-frames are of precisely the same kind—rectangular, polar,
ch. i the fundamental quadratic form 15
unaccelerated, rotating, etc.
2. The fundamental quadratic form.
We have to keep side by side the two methods of describing the
configurations of events by coordinates and by the mutual intervals,
respectively—the first for its conciseness, and the second for its immediate absolute significance. It is therefore necessary to connect the two
modes of description by a formula which will enable us to pass readily from one to the other. The particular formula will depend on the
coordinates chosen as well as on the absolute properties of the region
of the world considered; but it appears that in all cases the formula is
included in the following general form—
The interval ds between two neighbouring events with coordinates
(x1, x2, x3, x4) and (x1 + dx1, x2 + dx2, x3 + dx3, x4 + dx4) in any
coordinate-system is given by
ds2 = g11 dx2
1 + g22 dx2
2 + g33 dx2
3 + g44 dx2
4
+ 2g12 dx1 dx2 + 2g13 dx1 dx3 + 2g14 dx1 dx4
+ 2g23 dx2 dx3 + 2g24 dx2 dx4 + 2g34 dx3 dx4, (2.1)
where the coefficients g11, etc. are functions of x1, x2, x3, x4. That is
to say, ds2
is some quadratic function of the differences of coordinates.
This is, of course, not the most general case conceivable; for example, we might have a world in which the interval depended on a
general quartic function of the dx’s. But, as we shall presently see,
the quadratic form (2.1) is definitely indicated by observation as applying to the actual world. Moreover near the end of our task (§ 97)
we shall find in the general theory of relation-structure a precise reason
why a quadratic function of the coordinate-differences should have this
paramount importance.
ch. i measurement of intervals 16
Whilst the form of the right-hand side of (2.1) is that required by
observation, the insertion of ds2 on the left, rather than some other
function of ds, is merely a convention. The quantity ds is a measure of
the interval. It is necessary to consider carefully how measure-numbers
are to be affixed to the different intervals occurring in nature. We have
seen in the last section that equality of intervals can be tested observationally; but so far as we have yet gone, intervals are merely either equal
or unequal, and their differences have not been further particularised.
Just as wind-strength may be measured by velocity, or by pressure, or
by a number on the Beaufort scale, so the relation of extension between
two events could be expressed numerically according to many different
plans. To conform to (2.1) a particular code of measure-numbers must
be adopted; the nature and advantages of this code will be explained
in the next section.
The pure geometry associated with the general formula (2.1) was
studied by Riemann, and is generally called Riemannian geometry. It
includes Euclidean geometry as a special case.
3. Measurement of intervals.
Consider the operation of proving by measurement that a distance AB is equal to a distance CD. We take a configuration of events
LMNOP. . . , viz. a measuring-scale, and lay it over AB, and observe
that A and B coincide with two particular events P, Q (scale-divisions)
of the configuration. We find that the same configuration∗
can also
be arranged so that C and D coincide with P and Q respectively.
Further we apply all possible tests to the measuring-scale to see if it
∗The logical point may be noticed that the measuring-scale in two positions
(necessarily at different times) represents the same configuration of events, not the
same events.
ch. i measurement of intervals 17
has “changed” between the two measurements; and we are only satisfied that the measures are correct if no observable difference can be
detected. According to our fundamental axiom, the absence of any
observable difference between the two configurations (the structure of
the measuring-scale in its two positions) signifies that the intervals are
unchanged; in particular the interval between P and Q is unchanged.
It follows that the interval A to B is equal to the interval C to D.
We consider that the experiment proves equality of distance; but it is
primarily a test of equality of interval.
In this experiment time is not involved; and we conclude that in
space considered apart from time the test of equality of distance is
equality of interval. There is thus a one-to-one correspondence of
distances and intervals. We may therefore adopt the same measurenumber for the interval as is in general use for the distance, thus settling our plan of affixing measure-numbers to intervals. It follows that,
when time is not involved, the interval reduces to the distance.
It is for this reason that the quadratic form (2.1) is needed in order
to agree with observation, for it is well known that in three dimensions the square of the distance between two neighbouring points is a
quadratic function of their infinitesimal coordinate-differences—a result depending ultimately on the experimental law expressed by Euclid
i, 47.
When time is involved other appliances are used for measuring intervals. If we have a mechanism capable of cyclic motion, its cycles will
measure equal intervals provided the mechanism, its laws of behaviour,
and all relevant surrounding circumstances, remain precisely similar.
For the phrase “precisely similar” means that no observable differences
can be detected in the mechanism or its behaviour; and that, as we
have seen, requires that all corresponding intervals should be equal. In
particular the interval between the events marking the beginning and
ch. i rectangular coordinates and time 18
end of the cycle is unaltered. Thus a clock primarily measures equal intervals; it is only under more restricted conditions that it also measures
the time-coordinate t.
In general any repetition of an operation under similar conditions,
but for a different time, place, orientation and velocity (attendant circumstances which have a relative but not an absolute significance∗
),
tests, equality of interval.
It is obvious from common experience that intervals which can be
measured with a clock cannot be measured with a scale, and vice versa.
We have thus two varieties of intervals, which are provided for in the
formula (2.1), since ds2 may be positive or negative and the measure
of the interval will accordingly be expressed by a real or an imaginary
number. The abbreviated phrase “imaginary interval” must not be
allowed to mislead; there is nothing imaginary in the corresponding
relation; it is merely that in our arbitrary code an imaginary number
is assigned as its measure-number. We might have adopted a different
code, and have taken, for example, the antilogarithm of ds2 as the
measure of the interval; in that case space-intervals would have received
code-numbers from 1 to ∞, and time-intervals numbers from 0 to 1.
When we encounter √
−1 in our investigations, we must remember that
it has been introduced by our choice of measure-code and must not
think of it as occurring with some mystical significance in the external
world.
∗They express relations to events which are not concerned in the test, e.g. to
the sun and stars.
ch. i rectangular coordinates and time 19
4. Rectangular coordinates and time.
Suppose that we have a small region of the world throughout which
the g’s can be treated as constants∗
. In that case the right-hand side
of (2.1) can be broken up into the sum of four squares, admitting imaginary coefficients if necessary. Thus writing
y1 = a1x1 + a2x2 + a3x3 + a4x4,
y2 = b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3 + b4x4, etc.,
so that
dy1 = a1 dx1 + a2 dx2 + a3 dx3 + a4 dx4, etc.,
we can choose the constants a1, b1, . . . so that (2.1) becomes
ds2 = dy2
1 + dy2
2 + dy2
3 + dy2
4
. (4.1)
For, substituting for the dy’s and comparing coefficients with (2.1),
we have only 10 equations to be satisfied by the 16 constants. There
are thus many ways of making the reduction. Note, however, that the
reduction to the sum of four squares of complete differentials is not in
general possible for a large region, where the g’s have to be treated as
functions, not constants.
Consider all the events for which y4 has some specified value. These
will form a three-dimensional world. Since dy4 is zero for every pair of
these events, their mutual intervals are given by
ds2 = dy2
1 + dy2
2 + dy2
3
. (4.2)
∗
It will be shown in § 36 that it is always possible to transform the coordinates so
that the first derivatives of the g’s vanish at a selected point. We shall suppose that
this preliminary transformation has already been made, in order that the constancy
of the g’s may be a valid approximation through as large a region as possible round
the selected point.
ch. i rectangular coordinates and time 20
But this is exactly like familiar space in which the interval (which we
have shown to be the same as the distance for space without time) is
given by
ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2
, (4.3)
where x, y, z are rectangular coordinates.
Hence a section of the world by y4 = const. will appear to us as
space, and y1, y2, y3 will appear to us as rectangular coordinates. The
coordinate-frames y1, y2, y3, and x, y, z, are examples of the systems
S and S
0 of § 1, for which the intervals between corresponding pairs
of mesh-corners are equal. The two systems are therefore exactly alike
observationally; and if one appears to us to be a rectangular frame
in space, so also must the other. One proviso must be noted; the
coordinates y1, y2, y3 for real events must be real, as in familiar space,
otherwise the resemblance would be only formal.
Granting this proviso, we have reduced the general expression to
ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 + dy2
4
, (4.4)
where x, y, z will be recognised by us as rectangular coordinates in
space. Clearly y4 must involve the time, otherwise our location of
events by the four coordinates would be incomplete; but we must not
too hastily identify it with the time t.
I suppose that the following would be generally accepted as a satisfactory (pre-relativity) definition of equal time-intervals:—if we have
a mechanism capable of cyclic motion, its cycles will measure equal
durations of time anywhere and anywhen, provided the mechanism, its
laws of behaviour, and all outside influences remain precisely similar.
To this the relativist would add the condition that the mechanism (as
a whole) must be at rest in the space-time frame considered, because
it is now known that a clock in motion goes slow in comparison with
ch. i rectangular coordinates and time 21
a fixed clock. The non-relativist does not disagree in fact, though he
takes a slightly different view; he regards the proviso that the mechanism must be at rest as already included in his enunciation, because for
him motion involves progress through the aether, which (he considers)
directly affects the behaviour of the clock, and is one of those “outside
influences” which have to be kept “precisely similar.”
Since then it is agreed that the mechanism as a whole is to be at
rest, and the moving parts return to the same positions after a complete
cycle, we shall have for the two events marking the beginning and end
of the cycle
dx, dy, dz = 0.
Accordingly (4.4) gives for this case
ds2 = dy2
4
.
We have seen in § 3 that the cycles of the mechanism in all cases correspond to equal intervals ds; hence they correspond to equal values
of dy2
4
. But by the above definition of time they also correspond to
equal lapses of time dt; hence we must have dy4 proportional to dt, and
we express this proportionality by writing
dy4 = ic dt, (4.5)
where i =
√
−1, and c is a constant. It is, of course, possible that
c may be an imaginary number, but provisionally we shall suppose it
real. Then (4.4) becomes
ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 − c
2
dt2
. (4.6)
A further discussion is necessary before it is permissible to conclude
that (4.6) is the most general possible form for ds2
in terms of ordinary
ch. i rectangular coordinates and time 22
space and time coordinates. If we had reduced (2.1) to the rather more
general form
ds2 = dx2 +dy2 +dz2 −c
2
dt2 −2cα dx dt−2cβ dy dt−2cγ dz dt, (4.7)
this would have agreed with (4.6) in the only two cases yet discussed,
viz. (1) when dt = 0, and (2) when dx, dy, dz = 0. To show that
this more general form is inadmissible we must examine pairs of events
which differ both in time and place.
In the preceding pre-relativity definition of t our clocks had to remain stationary and were therefore of no use for comparing time at
different places. What did the pre-relativity physicist mean by the difference of time dt between two events at different places? I do not
think that we can attach any meaning to his hazy conception of what
dt signified; but we know one or two ways in which he was accustomed
to determine it. One method which he used was that of transport of
chronometers. Let us examine then what happens when we move a
clock from (x1, 0, 0) at the time t1 to another place (x2, 0, 0) at the
time t2.
We have seen that the clock, whether at rest or in motion, provided
it remains a precisely similar mechanism, records equal intervals; hence
the difference of the clock-readings at the beginning and end of the
journey will be proportional to the integrated interval
Z 2
1
ds. (4.81)
If the transport is made in the direct line (dy = 0, dz = 0), we shall
have according to (4.7)
−ds2 = c
2
dt2 + 2cα dx dt − dx2

Hence the difference of the clock-readings (4.81) is proportional to

, (4.82)
where u = dx/dt, i.e. the velocity of the clock. The integral will not in
general reduce to t2−t1; so that the difference of time at the two places
is not given correctly by the reading of the clock. Even when α = 0,
the moving clock does not record correct time.
Now introduce the condition that the velocity u is very small, remembering that t2 − t1 will then become very large. Neglecting u

(4.82) becomes

The clock, if moved sufficiently slowly, will record the correct timedifference if, and only if, α = 0. Moving it in other directions, we must
have, similarly, β = 0, γ = 0. Thus (4.6) is the most general formula
for the interval, when the time at different places is compared by slow
transport of clocks from one place to another.
I do not know how far the reader will be prepared to accept the condition that it must be possible to correlate the times at different places
by moving a clock from one to the other with infinitesimal velocity.
The method employed in accurate work is to send an electromagnetic
signal from one to the other, and we shall see in § 11 that this leads
ch. i rectangular coordinates and time 24
to the same formulae. We can scarcely consider that either of these
methods of comparing time at different places is an essential part of
our primitive notion of time in the same way that measurement at one
place by a cyclic mechanism is; therefore they are best regarded as conventional. Let it be understood, however, that although the relativity
theory has formulated the convention explicitly, the usage of the word
time-difference for the quantity fixed by this convention is in accordance with the long established practice in experimental physics and
astronomy.
Setting α = 0 in (4.82), we see that the accurate formula for the

for a uniform velocity u. Thus a clock travelling with finite velocity
gives too small a reading—the clock goes slow compared with the timereckoning conventionally adopted.
To sum up the results of this section, if we choose coordinates such
that the general quadratic form reduces to
ds2 = dy2
1 + dy2
2 + dy2
3 + dy2
4
, (4.95)
then y1, y2, y3 and y4

−1 will represent ordinary rectangular coordinates and time. If we choose coordinates for which
ds2 = dy2
1+dy2
2+dy2
3+dy2
4+2α dy1 dy4+2β dy2 dy4+2γ dy3 dy4, (4.96)
these coordinates also will agree with rectangular coordinates and time
so far as the more primitive notions of time are concerned; but the reckoning by this formula of differences of time at different places will not
ch. i the lorentz transformation 25
agree with the reckoning adopted in physics and astronomy according
to long established practice. For this reason it would only introduce
confusion to admit these coordinates as a permissible space and time
system.
We who regard all coordinate-frames as equally fictitious structures
have no special interest in ruling out the more general form (4.96). It
is not a question of ascribing greater significance to one frame than to
another, but of discovering which frame corresponds to the space and
time reckoning generally accepted and used in standard works such as
the Nautical Almanac.
As far as § 14 our work will be subject to the condition that we
are dealing with a region of the world in which the g’s are constant, or
approximately constant. A region having this property is called flat.
The theory of this case is called the “special” theory of relativity; it
was discussed by Einstein in 1905—some ten years before the general
theory. But it becomes much simpler when regarded as a special case
of the general theory, because it is no longer necessary to defend the
conditions for its validity as being essential properties of space-time.
For a given region these conditions may hold, or they may not. The
special theory applies only if they hold; other cases must be referred to
the general theory.

Hence from (4.6)

dt2 = dx02 + dy02 + dz02 − c

. (5.2)
The accented and unaccented coordinates give the same formula for
the interval, so that the intervals between corresponding pairs of meshcorners will be equal, and therefore in all observable respects they will
be alike. We shall recognise x
0
, y
0
, z
0 as rectangular coordinates in space,
and t
0 as the associated time. We have thus arrived at another possible
way of reckoning space and time—another fictitious space-time frame,
equivalent in all its properties to the original one. For convenience we
say that the first reckoning is that of an observer S and the second
that of an observer S
0
, both observers being at rest in their respective
spaces∗
.
The constant u is easily interpreted. Since S is at rest in his own
space, his location is given by x = const. By (5.1) this becomes, in
S

0 − ut0 = const.; that is to say, S is travelling in the
∗This is partly a matter of nomenclature. A sentient observer can force himself
to “recollect that he is moving” and so adopt a space in which he is not at rest;
but he does not so readily adopt the time which properly corresponds; unless he
uses the space-time frame in which he is at rest, he is likely to adopt a hybrid
space-time which leads to inconsistencies. There is no ambiguity if the “observer”
is regarded as merely an involuntary measuring apparatus, which by the principles
of § 4 naturally partitions a space and time with respect to which it is at rest.

as the velocity of S relative to S
0
.
It does not follow immediately that the velocity of S
0
relative to S
is −u; but this can be proved by algebraical solution of the equations (5.1) to determine x
0
, y
0
, z
0
, t
0
. We find
x
0 = β(x + ut), y0 = y, z0 = z, t0 = β(t + ux/c2
), (5.3)
showing that an interchange of S and S
0 merely reverses the sign of u.
The essential property of the foregoing transformation is that it
leaves the formula for ds2 unaltered (5.2), so that the coordinatesystems which it connects are alike in their properties. Looking at
the matter more generally, we have already noted that the reduction
to the sum of four squares can be made in many ways, so that we can
have
ds2 = dy2
1 + dy2
2 + dy2
3 + dy2
4 = dy02
1 + dy02
2 + dy02
3 + dy02

. (5.4)
The determination of the necessary connection between any two sets of
coordinates satisfying this equation is a problem of pure mathematics;
we can use freely the conceptions of four-dimensional geometry and
imaginary rotations to find this connection, whether the conceptions
have any physical significance or not. We see from (5.4) that ds is the
distance between two points in four-dimensional Euclidean space, the
coordinates (y1, y2, y3, y4) and (y
0

, y0
2
, y0

, y0

) being rectangular systems
(real or imaginary) in that space. Accordingly these coordinates are
related by the general transformations from one set of rectangular axes
to another in four dimensions, viz. translations and rotations. Translation, or change of origin, need not detain us; nor need a rotation of
the space-axes (y1, y2, y3) leaving time unaffected. The interesting case
is a rotation in which y4 is involved, typified by

ch. i the velocity of light 28
Writing u = ic tan θ, so that β = cos θ, this leads to the Lorentz transformation (5.1).
Thus, apart from obvious trivial changes of axes, the Lorentz transformations are the only ones which leave the form (4.6) unaltered.
Historically this transformation was first obtained for the particular case of electromagnetic equations. Its more general character was
pointed out by Einstein in 1905.
6. The velocity of light.
Consider a point moving along the x-axis whose velocity measured
by S
0
is v
0
, so that
v
0 =
dx0
dt0
. (6.1)
Then by (5.1) its velocity measured by S is
v =
dx
dt =
β(dx0 − u dt0
)
β(dt0 − u dx0/c2
)
=
v
0 − u
1 − uv0/c2
by (6.1). (6.2)
In non-relativity kinematics we should have taken it as axiomatic that
v = v
0 − u.
If two points move relatively to S
0 with equal velocities in opposite
directions +v
0 and −v
0
, their velocities relative to S are
v
0 − u
1 − uv0/c2
and −
v
0 + u
1 + uv0/c2
.
As we should expect, these speeds are usually unequal; but there is an
exceptional case when v
0 = c. The speeds relative to S are then also
equal, both in fact being equal to c.

Thus when the resultant velocity relative to S

is c, the velocity relative
to S is also c, whatever the direction. We see that the velocity c has a
unique and very remarkable property.
According to the older views of absolute time this result appears
incredible. Moreover we have not yet shown that the formulae have
practical significance, since c might be imaginary. But experiment has
revealed a real velocity with this remarkable property, viz. 299, 860 km.
per sec. We shall call this the fundamental velocity.
By good fortune there is an entity—light—which travels with the
fundamental velocity. It would be a mistake to suppose that the existence of such an entity is responsible for the prominence accorded to
the fundamental velocity c in our scheme; but it is helpful in rendering
it more directly accessible to experiment. The Michelson-Morley experiment detected no difference in the velocity of light in two directions at
right angles. Six months later the earth’s orbital motion had altered
the observer’s velocity by 60 km. per sec., corresponding to the change
from S
0
to S, and there was still no difference. Hence the velocity of
light has the distinctive property of the fundamental velocity.
Strictly speaking the Michelson-Morley experiment did not prove
directly that the velocity of light was constant in all directions, but
that the average to-and-fro velocity was constant in all directions. The
ch. i the velocity of light 30
experiment compared the times of a journey “there-and-back.” If v(θ) is
the velocity of light in the direction θ, the experimental result is

in 1010
.
It is exceedingly unlikely that the first equation could hold unless
v(θ) = v(θ + π) = const.;
and it is fairly obvious that the existence of the second equation excludes the possibility altogether. However, on account of the great
importance of the identification of the fundamental velocity with the
velocity of light, we give a formal proof.
Let a ray travelling with velocity v traverse a distance R in a direction θ, so that
dt = R/v, dx = R cos θ, dy = R sin θ.
Let the relative velocity of S and S
0 be small so that u
2/c2
is neglected.
Then by (5.3)
dt0 = dt + u dx/c2
, dx0 = dx + u dt, dy0 = dy.
Writing δR, δθ, δv for the change in R, θ, v when a transformation is
made to S
0
’s system, we obtain
δ(R/v) = dt0 − dt = uR cos θ/c2
,
δ(R cos θ) = dx0 − dx = uR/v,
δ(R sin θ) = dy0 − dy = 0.

ch. i the velocity of light 32
It is clearly impossible that the difference of 1/v in opposite directions
should be a function of θ of this form; because the origin of θ is merely
the direction of relative motion of S and S
0
, which may be changed at
will in different experiments, and has nothing to do with the propagation of light relative to S. Hence C
0 − C = 0, and v(θ) = v(θ + π).
Accordingly by (6.3) v(θ) is independent of θ; and similarly v
0
(θ) is independent of θ. Thus the velocity of light is uniform in all directions for
both observers and is therefore to be identified with the fundamental
velocity.
When this proof is compared with the statement commonly (and
correctly) made that the equality of the forward and backward velocity
of light cannot be deduced from experiment, regard must be paid to the
context. The use of the Michelson-Morley experiment to fill a particular gap in a generally deductive argument must not be confused with its
use (e.g. in Space, Time and Gravitation) as the basis of a pure induction from experiment. Here we have not even used the fact that it is a
second-order experiment. We have deduced the Lorentz transformation
from the fundamental hypothesis of § 1, and have already introduced
a conventional system of time-reckoning explained in § 4. The present
argument shows that the convention that time is defined by the slow
transport of chronometers is equivalent to the convention that the forward velocity of light is equal to the backward velocity. The proof of
this equivalence is mainly deductive except for one hiatus—the connection of the propagation of light and the fundamental velocity—and for
that step appeal is made to the Michelson-Morley experiment.
The law of composition of velocities (6.2) is well illustrated by
Fizeau’s experiment on the propagation of light along a moving stream
of water. Let the observer S
0
travel with the stream of water, and let
S be a fixed observer. The water is at rest relatively to S
0 and the
velocity of the light relative to him will thus be the ordinary velocity
ch. i timelike and spacelike intervals 33
of propagation in still water, viz. v
0 = c/µ, where µ is the refractive
index. The velocity of the stream being w, −w is the velocity of S
relative to S
0
; hence by (6.2) the velocity v of the light relative to S is
v =
v
0 + w
1 + wv0/c2
=
cµ + w
1 + w/µc
= c/µ + w(1 − 1/µ2
) approximately,
neglecting the square of w/c.
Accordingly the velocity of the light is not increased by the full
velocity of the stream in which it is propagated, but by the fraction
(1 − 1/µ2
)w. For water this is about 0.44w. The effect can be measured by dividing a beam of light into two parts which are sent in
opposite directions round a circulating stream of water. The factor
(1−1/µ2
) is known as Fresnel’s convection-coefficient; it was confirmed
experimentally by Fizeau in 1851.
If the velocity of light in vacuo were a constant c
0 differing from
the fundamental velocity c, the foregoing calculation would give for
Fresnel’s convection-coefficient
1 −

Thus Fizeau’s experiment provides independent evidence that the fundamental velocity is at least approximately the same as the velocity
of light. In the most recent repetitions of this experiment made by
Zeeman∗
the agreement between theory and observation is such that
c
0
cannot differ from c by more than 1 part in 500.

ch. i timelike and spacelike intervals 34
7. Timelike and spacelike intervals.
We make a slight change of notation, the quantity hitherto denoted by ds2 being in all subsequent formulae replaced by −ds2
, so
that (4.6) becomes
ds2 = c
2
dt2 − dx2 − dy2 − dz2
. (7.1)
There is no particular advantage in this change of sign; it is made in
order to conform to the customary notation.
The formula may give either positive or negative values of ds2
, so
that the interval between real events may be a real or an imaginary
number. We call real intervals timelike, and imaginary intervals spacelike.

where v is the velocity of a point describing the track along which
the interval lies. The interval is thus real or imaginary according as
v is less than or greater than c. Assuming that a material particle
cannot travel faster than light, the intervals along its track must be
timelike. We ourselves are limited by material bodies and therefore can
only have direct experience of timelike intervals. We are immediately
aware of the passage of time without the use of our external senses; but
we have to infer from our sense perceptions the existence of spacelike
intervals outside us.
From any event x, y, z, t, intervals radiate in all directions to other
events; and the real and imaginary intervals are separated by the cone
0 = c
2
dt2 − dx2 − dy2 − dz2
,
ch. i timelike and spacelike intervals 35
which is called the null-cone. Since light travels with velocity c, the
track of any light-pulse proceeding from the event lies on the null-cone.
When the g’s are not constants and the fundamental quadratic form
is not reducible to (7.1), there is still a null-surface, given by ds = 0
in (2.1), which separates the timelike and spacelike intervals. There
can be little doubt that in this case also the light-tracks lie on the nullsurface, but the property is perhaps scarcely self-evident, and we shall
have to justify it in more detail later.
The formula (6.2) for the composition of velocities in the same
straight line may be written
tanh−1
v/c = tanh−1
v
0
/c − tanh−1
u/c. (7.3)
The quantity tanh−1
v/c has been called by Robb the rapidity corresponding to the velocity v. Thus (7.3) shows that relative rapidities
in the same direction compound according to the simple addition-law.
Since tanh−1
1 = ∞ , the velocity of light corresponds to infinite rapidity. We cannot reach infinite rapidity by adding any finite number
of finite rapidities; therefore we cannot reach the velocity of light by
compounding any finite number of relative velocities less than that of
light.
There is an essential discontinuity between speeds greater than and
less than that of light which is illustrated by the following example. If
two points move in the same direction with velocities
v1 = c + , v2 = c − 
respectively, their relative velocity is by (6.2)

ch. i immediate consciousness of time 36
which tends to infinity as  is made infinitely small! If the fundamental
velocity is exactly 300, 000 km. per sec., and two points move in the
same direction with speeds of 300, 001 and 299, 999 km. per sec., the
speed of one relative to the other is 180, 000, 000, 000 km. per sec. The
barrier at 300, 000 km. per sec. is not to be crossed by approaching it.
A particle which is aiming to reach a speed of 300, 001 km. per sec.
might naturally hope to attain its object by continually increasing its
speed; but when it has reached 299, 999 km. per sec., and takes stock of
the position, it sees its goal very much farther off than when it started.
A particle of matter is a structure whose linear extension is timelike. We might perhaps imagine an analogous structure ranged along a
spacelike track. That would be an attempt to picture a particle travelling with a velocity greater than that of light; but since the structure
would differ fundamentally from matter as known to us, there seems no
reason to think that it would be recognised by us as a particle of matter, even if its existence were possible. For a suitably chosen observer
a spacelike track can lie wholly in an instantaneous space. The structure would exist along a line in space at one moment; at preceding and
succeeding moments it would be non-existent. Such instantaneous intrusions must profoundly modify the continuity of evolution from past
to future. In default of any evidence of the existence of these spacelike
particles we shall assume that they are impossible structures.
8. Immediate consciousness of time.
Our minds are immediately aware of a “flight of time” without the
intervention of external senses. Presumably there are more or less cyclic
processes occurring in the brain, which play the part of a material
clock, whose indications the mind can read. The rough measures of
duration made by the internal time-sense are of little use for scientific
ch. i immediate consciousness of time 37
purposes, and physics is accustomed to base time-reckoning on more
precise external mechanisms. It is, however, desirable to examine the
relation of this more primitive notion of time to the scheme developed
in physics.
Much confusion has arisen from a failure to realise that time as
currently used in physics and astronomy deviates widely from the time
recognised by the primitive time-sense. In fact the time of which we
are immediately conscious is not in general physical time, but the more
fundamental quantity which we have called interval (confined, however,
to timelike intervals).
Our time-sense is not concerned with events outside our brains; it
relates only to the linear chain of events along our own track through
the world. We may learn from another observer similar information
as to the time-succession of events along his track. Further we have
inanimate observers—clocks—from which we may obtain similar information as to their local time-successions. The combination of these
linear successions along different tracks into a complete ordering of
the events in relation to one another is a problem that requires careful analysis, and is not correctly solved by the haphazard intuitions
of pre-relativity physics. Recognising that both clocks and time-sense
measure ds between pairs of events along their respective tracks, we see
that the problem reduces to that which we have already been studying,
viz. to pass from a description in terms of intervals between pairs of
events to a description in terms of coordinates.
The external events which we see appear to fall into our own local
time-succession; but in reality it is not the events themselves, but the
sense-impressions to which they indirectly give rise, which take place in
the time-succession of our consciousness. The popular outlook does not
trouble to discriminate between the external events themselves and the
events constituted by their light-impressions on our brains; and hence
ch. i immediate consciousness of time 38
events throughout the universe are crudely located in our private timesequence. Through this confusion the idea has arisen that the instants
of which we are conscious extend so as to include external events, and
are world-wide; and the enduring universe is supposed to consist of a
succession of instantaneous states. This crude view was disproved in
1675 by R¨omer’s celebrated discussion of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites; and we are no longer permitted to locate external events in the
instant of our visual perception of them. The whole foundation of the
idea of world-wide instants was destroyed 250 years ago, and it seems
strange that it should still survive in current physics. But, as so often happens, the theory was patched up although its original raison
d’ˆetre had vanished. Obsessed with the idea that the external events
had to be put somehow into the instants of our private consciousness,
the physicist succeeded in removing the pressing difficulties by placing
them not in the instant of visual perception but in a suitable preceding instant. Physics borrowed the idea of world-wide instants from
the rejected theory, and constructed mathematical continuations of the
instants in the consciousness of the observer, making in this way timepartitions throughout the four-dimensional world. We need have no
quarrel with this very useful construction which gives physical time.
We only insist that its artificial nature should be recognised, and that
the original demand for a world-wide time arose through a mistake.
We should probably have had to invent universal time-partitions in
any case in order to obtain a complete mesh-system; but it might have
saved confusion if we had arrived at it as a deliberate invention instead
of an inherited misconception. If it is found that physical time has
properties which would ordinarily be regarded as contrary to common
sense, no surprise need be felt; this highly technical construct of physics
is not to be confounded with the time of common sense. It is important for us to discover the exact properties of physical time; but those
ch. i the “3 + 1 dimensional” world 39
properties were put into it by the astronomers who invented it.
9. The “3 + 1 dimensional” world.
The constant c
2
in (7.1) is positive according to experiments made
in regions of the world accessible to us. The 3 minus signs with 1 plus
sign particularise the world in a way which we could scarcely have
predicted from first principles. H. Weyl expresses this specialisation
by saying that the world is 3 + 1 dimensional. Some entertainment
may be derived by considering the properties of a 2 + 2 or a 4 + 0
dimensional world. A more serious question is, Can the world change
its type? Is it possible that in making the reduction of (2.1) to the sum
or difference of squares for some region remote in space or time, we
might have 4 minus signs? I think not; because if the region exists it
must be separated from our 3+1 dimensional region by some boundary.
On one side of the boundary we have
ds2 = −dx2 − dy2 − dz2 + c
2
1 dt2
,
and on the other side
ds2 = −dx2 − dy2 − dz2 − c
2
2 dt2
.
The transition can only occur through a boundary where
ds2 = −dx2 − dy2 − dz2 + 0 dt2
,
so that the fundamental velocity is zero. Nothing can move at the
boundary, and no influence can pass from one side to another. The
supposed region beyond is thus not in any spatio-temporal relation to
our own universe—which is a somewhat pedantic way of saying that it
does not exist.
ch. i the fitzgerald contraction 40
This barrier is more formidable than that which stops the passage of
light round the world in de Sitter’s spherical space-time (Space, Time
and Gravitation, p. 160). The latter stoppage was relative to the space
and time of a distant observer; but everything went on normally with
respect to the space and time of an observer at the region itself. But
here we are contemplating a barrier which does not recede as it is
approached.
The passage to a 2 + 2 dimensional world would occur through a
transition region where
ds2 = −dx2 − dy2 + 0 dz2 + c
2
dt2
.
Space here reduces to two dimensions, but there does not appear to
be any barrier. The conditions on the far side, where time becomes
two-dimensional, defy imagination.

which shows that S, besides making the allowance ut for the motion of
his origin, divides by β all lengths in the x-direction measured by S
0
.
On the other hand the equation y
0 = y shows that S accepts S
0
’s measures in directions transverse to their relative motion. Let S
0
take his
standard metre (at rest relative to him, and therefore moving relative
to S) and point it first in the transverse direction y
0 and then in the
longitudinal direction x
0
. For S
0
its length is 1 metre in each position,
ch. i the fitzgerald contraction 41
since it is his standard; for S the length is 1 metre in the transverse
position and 1/β metres in the longitudinal position. Thus S finds
that a moving rod contracts when turned from the transverse to the
longitudinal position.
The question remains, How does the length of this moving rod compare with the length of a similarly constituted rod at rest relative to S?
The answer is that the transverse dimensions are the same whilst the
longitudinal dimensions are contracted. We can prove this by a reductio
ad absurdum. For suppose that a rod moving transversely were longer
than a similar rod at rest. Take two similar transverse rods A and A0
at rest relatively to S and S
0
respectively. Then S must regard A0 as
the longer, since it is moving relatively to him; and S
0 must regard A as
the longer, since it is moving relatively to him. But this is impossible
since, according to the equation y = y
0
, S and S
0 agree as to transverse
measures.
We see that the Lorentz transformation (5.1) requires that (x, y, z, t)
and (x
0
, y0
, z0
, t0
) should be measured with standards of identical material constitution, but moving respectively with S and S
0
. This was
really implicit in our deduction of the transformation, because the property of the two systems is that they give the same formula (5.2) for the
interval; and the test of complete similarity of the standards is equality
of all corresponding intervals occurring in them.
The fourth equation of (5.1) is
t = β(t
0 − ux0
/c2
).
Consider a clock recording the time t
0
, which accordingly is at rest in
S
0
’s system (x = const.). Then for any time-lapse by this clock, we
have
δt = β δt0
,
ch. i the fitzgerald contraction 42
since δx0 = 0. That is to say, S does not accept the time as recorded by
this moving clock, but multiplies its readings by β, as though the clock
were going slow. This agrees with the result already found in (4.9).
It may seem strange that we should be able to deduce the contraction of a material rod and the retardation of a material clock from the
general geometry of space and time. But it must be remembered that
the contraction and retardation do not imply any absolute change in
the rod and clock. The “configuration of events” constituting the fourdimensional structure which we call a rod is unaltered; all that happens
is that the observer’s space and time partitions cross it in a different
direction.
Further we make no prediction as to what would happen to the rod
set in motion in an actual experiment. There may or may not be an
absolute change of the configuration according to the circumstances by
which it is set in motion. Our results apply to the case in which the
rod after being set in motion is (according to all experimental tests)
found to be similar to the rod in its original state of rest∗
.
When a number of phenomena are connected together it becomes
somewhat arbitrary to decide which is to be regarded as the explanation of the others. To many it will seem easier to regard the strange
property of the fundamental velocity as explained by these differences
of behaviour of the observers’ clocks and scales. They would say that
the observers arrive at the same value of the velocity of light because
they omit the corrections which would allow for the different behaviour
of their measuring-appliances. That is the relative point of view, in
which the relative quantities, length, time, etc., are taken as funda-
∗
It may be impossible to change the motion of a rod without causing a rise of
temperature. Our conclusions will then not apply until the temperature has fallen
again, i.e. until the temperature-test shows that the rod is precisely similar to the
rod before the change of motion.
ch. i simultaneity at different places 43
mental. From the absolute point of view, which has regard to intervals
only, the standards of the two observers are equal and behave similarly;
the so-called explanations of the invariance of the velocity of light only
lead us away from the root of the matter.
Moreover the recognition of the FitzGerald contraction does not
enable us to avoid paradox. From (5.3) we found that S
0
’s longitudinal
measuring-rods were contracted relatively to those of S. From (5.1)
we can show similarly that S’s rods are contracted relatively to those
of S
0
. There is complete reciprocity between S and S
0
. This paradox
is discussed more fully in Space, Time and Gravitation, p. 55.
11. Simultaneity at different places.
It will be seen from the fourth equation of (5.1), viz.
dt = −β(t
0 − ux0
/c2
),
that events at different places which are simultaneous for S
0 are not in
general simultaneous for S. In fact, if dt0 = 0,
dt = −βu dx0
/c2
. (11.1)
It is of some interest to examine in detail how this difference of
reckoning of simultaneity arises. It has been explained in § 4 that by
convention the time at two places is compared by transporting a clock
from one to the other with infinitesimal velocity. Our formulae are
based on this convention; and, of course, (11.1) will only be true if the
convention is adhered to. The fact that infinitesimal velocity relative
to S
0
is not the same as infinitesimal velocity relative to S, leaves room
for the discrepancy of reckoning of simultaneity to creep in. Consider
two points A and B at rest relative to S
0
, and distant x
0 apart. Take
ch. i simultaneity at different places 44
a clock at A and move it gently to B by giving it an infinitesimal
velocity du0
for a time x
0/du0
. Owing to the motion, the clock will
by (4.9) be retarded in the ratio (1 − du02/c2
)
− 1
2 ; this continues for a
time x
0/du0 and the total loss is thus

1 − (1 − du02
/c2
)
1
2
	
x
0
/du0
,
which tends to zero when du0
is infinitely small. S
0 may accordingly
accept the result of the comparison without applying any correction for
the motion of the clock.
Now consider S’s view of this experiment. For him the clock had
already a velocity u, and accordingly the time indicated by the clock is
only (1−u
2/c2
)
1
2 of the true time for S. By differentiation, an additional
velocity du∗
causes a supplementary loss
(1 − u
2
/c2
)
− 1
2 u du/c2
clock seconds (11.2)
per true second. Owing to the FitzGerald contraction of the length AB,
the distance to be travelled is x
0/β, and the journey will occupy a time
x
0
/β du true seconds. (11.3)
Multiplying (11.2) and (11.3), the total loss due to the journey is
ux0
/c2
clock seconds,
or
βux0
/c2
true seconds for S. (11.4)
Thus, whilst S
0 accepts the uncorrected result of the comparison,
S has to apply a correction βux0/c2
for the disturbance of the chronometer through transport. This is precisely the difference of their reckonings
of simultaneity given by (11.1).
∗Note that du will not be equal to du0
.
ch. i simultaneity at different places 45
In practice an accurate comparison of time at different places
is made, not by transporting chronometers, but by electromagnetic
signals—usually wireless time-signals for places on the earth, and lightsignals for places in the solar system or stellar universe. Take two
clocks at A and B, respectively. Let a signal leave A at clock-time t1,
reach B at time tB by the clock at B, and be reflected to reach A again
at time t2. The observer S
0
, who is at rest relatively to the clocks, will
conclude that the instant tB at B was simultaneous with the instant
1
2
(t1 + t2) at A, because he assumes that the forward velocity of light
is equal to the backward velocity. But for S the two clocks are moving
with velocity u; therefore he calculates that the outward journey will
occupy a time x/(c − u) and the homeward journey a time x/(c + u).
Now
x
c − u
=
x(c + u)
c
2 − u
2
=

(c + u),
x
c + u
=
x(c − u)
c

2
=
β
2x
c

(c + u).
Thus the instant tB of arrival at B must be taken as β
2xu/c2
later
than the half-way instant 1
2
(t1 + t2). This correction applied by S, but
not by S
0
, agrees with (11.4) when we remember that owing to the
FitzGerald contraction x = x
0/β.
Thus the same difference in the reckoning of simultaneity by S
and S
0 appears whether we use the method of transport of clocks or of
light-signals. In either case a convention is introduced as to the reckoning of time-differences at different places; this convention takes in the
two methods the alternative forms—
(1) A clock moved with infinitesimal velocity from one place to
another continues to read the correct time at its new station, or
ch. i momentum and mass 46
(2) The forward velocity of light along any line is equal to the backward velocity∗
.
Neither statement is by itself a statement of observable fact, nor
does it refer to any intrinsic property of clocks or of light; it is simply an
announcement of the rule by which we propose to extend fictitious timepartitions through the world. But the mutual agreement of the two
statements is a fact which could be tested by observation, though owing
to the obvious practical difficulties it has not been possible to verify
it directly. We have here given a theoretical proof of the agreement,
depending on the truth of the fundamental axiom of § 1.
The two alternative forms of the convention are closely connected.
In general, in any system of time-reckoning, a change du in the velocity
of a clock involves a change of rate proportional to du, but there is
a certain turning-point for which the change of rate is proportional
to du2
. In adopting a time-reckoning such that this stationary point
corresponds to his own motion, the observer is imposing a symmetry
on space and time with respect to himself, which may be compared
with the symmetry imposed in assuming a constant velocity of light in
all directions. Analytically we imposed the same general symmetry by
adopting (4.6) instead of (4.7) as the form for ds2
, making our spacetime reckoning symmetrical with respect to the interval and therefore
with respect to all observational criteria.
∗The chief case in which we require for practical purposes an accurate convention
as to the reckoning of time at places distant from the earth, is in calculating the
elements and mean places of planets and comets. In these computations the velocity
of light in any direction is taken to be 300, 000 km. per sec., an assumption which
rests on the convention (2). All experimental methods of measuring the velocity of
light determine only an average to-and-fro velocity.
ch. i momentum and mass 47
12. Momentum and mass.
Besides possessing extension in space and time, matter possesses
inertia. We shall show in due course that inertia, like extension, is
expressible in terms of the interval relation; but that is a development
belonging to a later stage of our theory. Meanwhile we give an elementary treatment based on the empirical laws of conservation of momentum and energy rather than on any deep-seated theory of the nature of
inertia.
For the discussion of space and time we have made use of certain
ideal apparatus which can only be imperfectly realised in practice—
rigid scales and perfect cyclic mechanisms or clocks, which always remain similar configurations from the absolute point of view. Similarly
for the discussion of inertia we require some ideal material object, say a
perfectly elastic billiard ball, whose condition as regards inertial properties remains constant from an absolute point of view. The difficulty
that actual billiard balls are not perfectly elastic must be surmounted
in the same way as the difficulty that actual scales are not rigid. To
the ideal billiard ball we can affix a constant number, called the invariant mass∗
, which will denote its absolute inertial properties; and this
number is supposed to remain unaltered throughout the vicissitudes of
its history, or, if temporarily disturbed during a collision, is restored at
the times when we have to examine the state of the body.
With the customary definition of momentum, the components
M
dx
dt , M dy
dt , M dz
dt (12.1)
cannot satisfy a general law of conservation of momentum unless the
mass M is allowed to vary with the velocity. But with the slightly
∗Or proper-mass.
ch. i momentum and mass 48
modified definition
m

ds , m
dy
ds , m

ds (12.2)
the law of conservation can be satisfied simultaneously in all space-time
systems, m being an invariant number. This was shown in Space, Time
and Gravitation, p. 142.
Comparing (12.1) and (12.2), we have
M = m
dt
ds. (12.3)
We call m the invariant mass, and M the relative mass, or simply the
mass.
The term “invariant” signifies unchanged for any transformation of
coordinates, and, in particular, the same for all observers; constancy
during the life-history of the body is an additional property of m attributed to our ideal billiard balls, but not assumed to be true for
matter in general.
Choosing units of length and time so that the velocity of light is
unity, we have by (7.2)
ds
dt = (1 − v
2
)
1
2 .
Hence by (12.3)
M = m(1 − v
2
)
− 1
2 . (12.4)
The mass increases with the velocity by the same factor as that which
gives the FitzGerald contraction; and when v = 0, M = m. The
invariant mass is thus equal to the mass at rest.
It is natural to extend (12.2) by adding a fourth component, thus
m

ch. i momentum and mass 49
By (12.3) the fourth component is equal to M. Thus the momenta
and mass (relative mass) form together a symmetrical expression, the
momenta being space-components, and the mass the time-component.
We shall see later that the expression (12.5) constitutes a vector, and
the laws of conservation of momentum and mass assert the conservation
of this vector.
The following is an analytical proof of the law of variation of mass
with velocity directly from the principle of conservation of mass and
momentum. Let M1, M0
1 be the mass of a body as measured by S and
S
0
respectively, v1, v
0
1 being its velocity in the x-direction. Writing

− 1
2 ,
we can easily verify from (6.2) that
β1v1 = ββ0
1
(v
0
1 − u). (12.6)
Let a number of such particles be moving in a straight line subject
to the conservation of mass and momentum as measured by S
0
, viz.
XM0
1
and XM0
1
v
0
1
are conserved.
Since β and u are constants it follows that
XM0
1β(v
0
1 − u) is conserved.
Therefore by (12.6)
XM0
1β1v1/β0
1
is conserved. (12.71)
But since momentum must also be conserved for the observer S
XM1v1 is conserved. (12.72)
ch. i energy 50
The results (12.71) and (12.72) will agree if
M1/β1 = M0
1
/β0
1
,
and it is easy to see that there can be no other general solution. Hence
for different values of v1, M1 is proportional to β1, or
M = m(1 − v
2
/c2
)
− 1
2 ,
where m is a constant for the body.
It requires a greater impulse to produce a given change of velocity δv
in the original direction of motion than to produce an equal change δw
at right angles to it. For the momenta in the two directions are initially
mv(1 − v

and after a change δv, δw, they become

where β is the FitzGerald factor for velocity v. The coefficient Mβ2
was formerly called the longitudinal mass, M being the transverse mass;
but the longitudinal mass is of no particular importance in the general
theory, and the term is dropping out of use.
ch. i energy 51
13. Energy.
When the units are such that c = 1, we have
M = m(1 − v
2
)
− 1
2
= m +
1
2mv2
approximately, (13.1)
if the speed is small compared with the velocity of light. The second
term is the kinetic energy, so that the change of mass is the same as
the change of energy, when the velocity alters. This suggests the identification of mass with energy. It may be recalled that in mechanics
the total energy of a system is left vague to the extent of an arbitrary
additive constant, since only changes of energy are defined. In identifying energy with mass we fix the additive constant m for each body,
and m may be regarded as the internal energy of constitution of the
body.
The approximation used in (13.1) does not invalidate the argument.
Consider two ideal billiard balls colliding. The conservation of mass
(relative mass) states that
Xm(1 − v
2
)
− 1
2 is unaltered.
The conservation of energy states that
Xm(1 + 1
2
v
2
) is unaltered.
But if both statements were exactly true we should have two equations
determining unique values of the speeds of the two balls; so that these
speeds could not be altered by the collision. The two laws are not
independent, but one is an approximation to the other. The first is
the accurate law since it is independent of the space-time frame of
ch. i energy 52
reference. Accordingly the expression 1
2mv2
for the kinetic energy in
elementary mechanics is only an approximation in which terms in v
4
,
etc. are neglected.
When the units of length and time are not restricted by the condition c = 1, the relation between the mass M and the energy E is
M = E/c2
. (13.2)
Thus the energy corresponding to a gram is 9 · 1020 ergs. This does
not affect the identity of mass and energy—that both are measures
of the same world-condition. A world-condition can be examined by
different kinds of experimental tests, and the units gram and erg are
associated with different tests of the mass-energy condition. But when
once the measure has been made it is of no consequence to us which
of the experimental methods was chosen, and grams or ergs can be
used indiscriminately as the unit of mass. In fact, measures made by
energy-tests and by mass-tests are convertible like measures made with
a yard-rule and a metre-rule.
The principle of conservation of mass has thus become merged in the
principle of conservation of energy. But there is another independent
phenomenon which perhaps corresponds more nearly to the original
idea of Lavoisier when he enunciated the law of conservation of matter.
I refer to the permanence of invariant mass attributed to our ideal billiard balls but not supposed to be a general property of matter. The
conservation of m is an accidental property like rigidity; the conservation of M is an invariable law of nature.
When radiant heat falls on a billiard ball so that its temperature
rises, the increased energy of motion of the molecules causes an increase
of mass M. The invariant mass m also increases since it is equal to M
for a body at rest. There is no violation of the conservation of M,
because the radiant heat has mass M which it transfers to the ball; but
ch. i density and temperature 53
we shall show later that the electromagnetic waves have no invariant
mass, and the addition to m is created out of nothing. Thus invariant
mass is not conserved in general.
To some extent we can avoid this failure by taking the microscopic
point of view. The billiard ball can be analysed into a very large number of constituents—electrons and protons—each of which is believed
to preserve the same invariant mass for life. But the invariant mass of
the billiard ball is not exactly equal to the sum of the invariant masses
of its constituents∗
. The permanence and permanent similarity of all
electrons seems to be the modern equivalent of Lavoisier’s “conservation of matter.” It is still uncertain whether it expresses a universal
law of nature; and we are willing to contemplate the possibility that
occasionally a positive and negative electron may coalesce and annul
one another. In that case the mass M would pass into the electromagnetic waves generated by the catastrophe, whereas the invariant
mass m would disappear altogether. Again if ever we are able to synthesise helium out of hydrogen, 0.8 per cent, of the invariant mass will
be annihilated, whilst the corresponding proportion of relative mass
will be liberated as radiant energy.
It will thus be seen that although in the special problems considered
the quantity m is usually supposed to be permanent, its conservation
belongs to an altogether different order of ideas from the universal
conservation of M.
∗This is because the invariant mass of each electron is its relative mass referred
to axes moving with it; the invariant mass of the billiard ball is the relative mass
referred to axes at rest in the billiard ball as a whole.
ch. i density and temperature 54
14. Density and temperature.
Consider a volume of space delimited in some invariant way, e.g.
the content of a material box. The counting of a number of discrete
particles continually within (i.e. moving with) the box is an absolute
operation; let the absolute number be N. The volume V of the box
will depend on the space-reckoning, being decreased in the ratio β for
an observer moving relatively to the box and particles, owing to the
FitzGerald contraction of one of the dimensions of the box. Accordingly
the particle-density σ = N/V satisfies
σ
0 = σβ, (14.1)
where σ
0
is the particle-density for an observer in relative motion, and
σ the particle-density for an observer at rest relative to the particles.
It follows that the mass-density ρ obeys the equation
ρ
0 = ρβ2
, (14.2)
since the mass of each particle is increased for the moving observer in
the ratio β.
Quantities referred to the space-time system of an observer moving
with the body considered are often distinguished by the prefix proper-
(German, Eigen-), e.g. proper-length, proper-volume, proper-density,
proper-mass = invariant mass.
The transformation of temperature for a moving observer does
not often concern us. In general the word obviously means propertemperature, and the motion of the observer does not enter into
consideration. In thermometry and in the theory of gases it is essential
to take a standard with respect to which the matter is at rest on the
average, since the indication of a thermometer moving rapidly through
ch. i general transformations of coordinates 55
a fluid is of no practical interest. But thermodynamical temperature is
defined by
dS = dM/T, (14.3)
where dS is the change of entropy for a change of energy dM. The
temperature T defined by this equation will depend on the observer’s
frame of reference. Entropy is clearly meant to be an invariant, since it
depends on the probability of the statistical state of the system compared with other states which might exist. Hence T must be altered by
motion in the same way as dM, that is to say
T
0 = βT. (14.4)
But it would be useless to apply such a transformation to the adiabatic
gas-equation
T = kργ−1
,
for, in that case, T is evidently intended to signify the propertemperature and ρ the proper-density.
In general it is unprofitable to apply the Lorentz transformation
to the constitutive equations of a material medium and to coefficients
occurring in them (permeability, specific inductive capacity, elasticity,
velocity of sound). Such equations naturally take a simpler and more
significant form for axes moving with the matter. The transformation
to moving axes introduces great complications without any evident advantages, and is of little interest except as an analytical exercise.

In the transformation (15.3) we have paid no attention to any contraction of the standards of length or retardation of clocks due to motion with the rotating axes. The formulae of transformation are those
of elementary kinematics, so that x

are quite strictly the
coordinates used in the ordinary theory of rotating axes. But it may be
suggested that elementary kinematics is now seen to be rather crude,
and that it would be worth while to touch up the formulae (15.3) so
as to take account of these small changes of the standards. A little
consideration shows that the suggestion is impracticable. It was shown
in § 4 that if x

ds2 = −dx02

, (15.45)
so that coordinates which give any other formula for the interval cannot
represent the immediate indications of scales and clocks. As shown at
the end of § 5, the only transformations which give (15.45) are Lorentz
ch. i general transformations of coordinates 58
transformations. If we wish to make a transformation of a more general
kind, such as that of (15.3), we must necessarily abandon the association of the coordinate-system with uncorrected scale and clock readings. It is useless to try to “improve” the transformation to rotating
axes, because the supposed improvement could only lead us back to a
coordinate-system similar to the fixed axes with which we started.
The inappropriateness of rotating axes to scale and clock measurements can be regarded from a physical point of view. We cannot keep
a scale or clock at rest in the rotating system unless we constrain it, i.e.
subject it to molecular bombardment—an “outside influence” whose
effect on the measurements must not be ignored.
In the x, y, z, t system of coordinates the scale and clock are the
natural equipment for exploration. In other systems they will, if unconstrained, continue to measure ds; but the reading of ds is no longer
related in a simple way to the differences of coordinates which we wish
to determine; it depends on the more complicated calculations involved
in (2.1). The scale and clock to some extent lose their pre-eminence,
and since they are rather elaborate appliances it may be better to refer
to some simpler means of exploration. We consider then two simpler
test-objects—the moving particle and the light-pulse.
In ordinary rectangular coordinates and time x, y, z, t an undisturbed particle moves with uniform velocity, so that its track is given
by the equations
x = a + bt, y = c + dt, z = e + f t, (15.5)
i.e. the equations of a straight line in four dimensions. By substituting from (15.3) we could find the equations of the track in rotating
coordinates; or by substituting from (15.2) we could obtain the differential equations for any desired coordinates. But there is another way
ch. i general transformations of coordinates 59
of proceeding. The differential equations of the track may be written

= 0, (15.6)
which on integration, having regard to the condition (7.1), give equations (15.5).
The equations (15.6) are comprised in the single statement
Z
ds is stationary (15.7)
for all arbitrary small variations of the track which vanish at the initial
and final limits—a well-known property of the straight line.
In arriving at (15.7) we use freely the geometry of the x, y, z, t
system given by (7.1); but the final result does not allude to coordinates
at all, and must be unaltered whatever system of coordinates we are
using. To obtain explicit equations for the track in any desired system
of coordinates, we substitute in (15.7) the appropriate expression (2.1)
for ds and apply the calculus of variations. The actual analysis will be
given in § 28.
The track of a light-pulse, being a straight line in four dimensions,
will also satisfy (15.7); but the light-pulse has the special velocity c
which gives the additional condition obtained in § 7, viz.
ds = 0. (15.8)
Here again there is no reference to any coordinates in the final result.
We have thus obtained equations (15.7) and (15.8) for the behaviour
of the moving particle and light-pulse which must hold good whatever
the coordinate-system chosen. The indications of our two new testbodies are connected with the interval, just as in § 3 the indications
ch. i fields of force 60
of the scale and clock were connected with the interval. It should be
noticed however that whereas the use of the older test-bodies depends
only on the truth of the fundamental axiom, the use of the new testbodies depends on the truth of the empirical laws of motion and of
light-propagation. In a deductive theory this appeal to empirical laws
is a blemish which we must seek to remove later.
16. Fields of force.
Suppose that an observer has chosen a definite system of spacecoordinates and of time-reckoning (x1, x2, x3, x4) and that the geometry
of these is given by
ds2 = g11 dx2
1 + g22 dx2
2 + · · · + 2g12 dx1 dx2
2 + · · · . (16.1)
Let him be under the mistaken impression that the geometry is
ds2
0 = −dx2
1 − dx2
2 − dx2
3 + dx2
4
, (16.2)
that being the geometry with which he is most familiar in pure mathematics. We use ds0 to distinguish his mistaken value of the interval.
Since intervals can be compared by experimental methods, he ought
soon to discover that his ds cannot be reconciled with observational results, and so realise his mistake. But the mind does not so readily get
rid of an obsession. It is more likely that our observer will continue in
his opinion, and attribute the discrepancy of the observations to some
influence which is present and affects the behaviour of his test-bodies.
He will, so to speak, introduce a supernatural agency which he can
blame for the consequences of his mistake. Let us examine what name
he would apply to this agency.
Of the four test-bodies considered the moving particle is in general
the most sensitive to small changes of geometry, and it would be by
ch. i fields of force 61
this test that the observer would first discover discrepancies. The path
laid down for it by our observer is
Z
ds0 is stationary,
i.e. a straight line in the coordinates (x1, x2, x3, x4). The particle, of
course, pays no heed to this, and moves in the different track
Z
ds is stationary.
Although apparently undisturbed it deviates from “uniform motion in
a straight line.” The name given to any agency which causes deviation from uniform motion in a straight line is force according to the
Newtonian definition of force. Hence the agency invoked through our
observer’s mistake is described as a “field of force.”
The field of force is not always introduced by inadvertence as in the
foregoing illustration. It is sometimes introduced deliberately by the
mathematician, e.g. when he introduces the centrifugal force. There
would be little advantage and many disadvantages in banishing the
phrase “field of force” from our vocabulary. We shall therefore regularise the procedure which our observer has adopted. We call (16.2) the
abstract geometry of the system of coordinates (x1, x2, x3, x4); it may
be chosen arbitrarily by the observer. The natural geometry is (16.1).
A field of force represents the discrepancy between the natural geometry of a coordinate-system and the abstract geometry arbitrarily ascribed to it.
A field of force thus arises from an attitude of mind. If we do not
take our coordinate-system to be something different from that which
it really is, there is no field of force. If we do not regard our rotating
axes as though they were non-rotating, there is no centrifugal force.
ch. i fields of force 62
Coordinates for which the natural geometry is
ds2 = −dx2
1 − dx2
2 − dx2
3 + dx2
4
are called Galilean coordinates. They are the same as those we have
hitherto called ordinary rectangular coordinates and time (the velocity
of light being unity). Since this geometry is familiar to us, and enters largely into current conceptions of space, time and mechanics, we
usually choose Galilean geometry when we have to ascribe an abstract
geometry. Or we may use slight modifications of it, e.g. substitute polar
for rectangular coordinates.
It has been shown in § 4 that when the g’s are constants, coordinates can be chosen so that Galilean geometry is actually the natural
geometry. There is then no need to introduce a field of force in order to enjoy our accustomed outlook; and if we deliberately choose
non-Galilean coordinates and attribute to them abstract Galilean geometry, we recognise the artificial character of the field of force introduced to compensate the discrepancy. But in the more general case
it is not possible to make the reduction of § 4 accurately throughout
the region explored by our experiments; and no Galilean coordinates
exist. In that case it has been usual to select some system (preferably
an approximation to a Galilean system) and ascribe to it the abstract
geometry of the Galilean system. The field of force so introduced is
called “Gravitation.”
It should be noticed that the rectangular coordinates and time in
current use can scarcely be regarded as a close approximation to the
Galilean system, since the powerful force of terrestrial gravitation is
needed to compensate the error.
The naming of coordinates (e.g. time) usually follows the abstract
geometry attributed to the system. In general the natural geometry is
ch. i fields of force 63
of some complicated kind for which no detailed nomenclature is recognised. Thus when we call a coordinate t the “time,” we may either
mean that it fulfils the observational conditions discussed in § 4, or we
may mean that any departure from those conditions will be ascribed
to the interference of a field of force. In the latter case “time” is an
arbitrary name, useful because it fixes a consequential nomenclature of
velocity, acceleration, etc.
To take a special example, an observer at a station on the earth has
found a particular set of coordinates x1, x2, x3, x4 best suited to his
needs. He calls them x, y, z, t in the belief that they are actually rectangular coordinates and time, and his terminology—straight line, circle,
density, uniform velocity, etc.—follows from this identification. But, as
shown in § 4, this nomenclature can only agree with the measures made
by clocks and scales provided (16.2) is satisfied; and if (16.2) is satisfied,
the tracks of undisturbed particles must be straight lines. Experiment
immediately shows that this is not the case; the tracks of undisturbed
particles are parabolas. But instead of accepting the verdict of experiment and admitting that x1, x2, x3, x4 are not what he supposed they
were, our observer introduces a field of force to explain why his test
is not fulfilled. A certain part of this field of force might have been
avoided if he had taken originally a different set of coordinates (not
rotating with the earth); and in so far as the field of force arises on this
account it is generally recognised that it is a mathematical fiction—the
centrifugal force. But there is a residuum which cannot be got rid of by
any choice of coordinates; there exists no extensive coordinate-system
having the simple properties which were ascribed to x, y, z, t. The
intrinsic nature of space-time near the earth is not of the kind which
admits coordinates with Galilean geometry. This irreducible field of
force constitutes the field of terrestrial gravitation. The statement that
space-time round the earth is “curved”—that is to say, that it is not
ch. i the principle of equivalence 64
of the kind which admits Galilean coordinates—is not an hypothesis;
it is an equivalent expression of the observed fact that an irreducible
field of force is present, having regard to the Newtonian definition of
force. It is this fact of observation which demands the introduction of
non-Galilean space-time and non-Euclidean space into the theory.
17. The Principle of Equivalence.
In § 15 we have stated the laws of motion of undisturbed material
particles and of light-pulses in a form independent of the coordinates
chosen. Since a great deal will depend upon the truth of these laws it
is desirable to consider what justification there is for believing them to
be both accurate and universal. Three courses are open:
(a) It will be shown in Chapters IV and VI that these laws follow
rigorously from a more fundamental discussion of the nature of matter
and of electromagnetic fields; that is to say, the hypotheses underlying
them may be pushed a stage further back.
(b) The track of a moving particle or light-pulse under specified
initial conditions is unique, and it does not seem to be possible to
specify any unique tracks in terms of intervals only other than those
given by equations (15.7) and (15.8).
(c) We may arrive at these laws by induction from experiment.
If we rely solely on experimental evidence we cannot claim exactness for the laws. It goes without saying that there always remains a
possibility of small amendments of the laws too slight to affect any observational tests yet tried. Belief in the perfect accuracy of (15.7) and
(15.8) can only be justified on the theoretical grounds (a) or (b). But
the more important consideration is the universality, rather than the
accuracy, of the experimental laws; we have to guard against a spurious
generalisation extended to conditions intrinsically dissimilar from those
ch. i the principle of equivalence 65
for which the laws have been established observationally.
We derived (15.7) from the equations (15.5) which describe the observed behaviour of a particle moving under no field of force. We assume
that the result holds in all circumstances. The risky point in the generalisation is not in introducing a field of force, because that may be due
to an attitude of mind of which the particle has no cognizance. The
risk is in passing from regions of the world where Galilean coordinates
(x, y, z, t) are possible to intrinsically dissimilar regions where no such
coordinates exist—from flat space-time to space-time which is not flat.
The Principle of Equivalence asserts the legitimacy of this generalisation. It is essentially an hypothesis to be tested by experiment as
opportunity offers. Moreover it is to be regarded as a suggestion, rather
than a dogma admitting of no exceptions. It is likely that some of the
phenomena will be determined by comparatively simple equations in
which the components of curvature of the world do not appear; such
equations will be the same for a curved region as for a flat region. It is
to these that the Principle of Equivalence applies. It is a plausible suggestion that the undisturbed motion of a particle and the propagation
of light are governed by laws of this specially simple type; and accordingly (15.7) and (15.8) will apply in all circumstances. But there are
more complex phenomena governed by equations in which the curvatures of the world are involved; terms containing these curvatures will
vanish in the equations summarising experiments made in a flat region,
and would have to be reinstated in passing to the general equations.
Clearly there must be some phenomena of this kind which discriminate
between a flat world and a curved world; otherwise we could have no
knowledge of world-curvature. For these the Principle of Equivalence
breaks down.
The Principle of Equivalence thus asserts that some of the chief
differential equations of physics are the same for a curved region of the
ch. i retrospect 66
world as for an osculating flat region∗
. There can be no infallible rule for
generalising experimental laws; but the Principle of Equivalence offers
a suggestion for trial, which may be expected to succeed sometimes,
and fail sometimes.
The Principle of Equivalence has played a great part as a guide in
the original building up of the generalised relativity theory; but now
that we have reached the new view of the nature of the world it has
become less necessary. Our present exposition is in the main deductive.
We start with a general theory of world-structure and work down to
the experimental consequences, so that our progress is from the general
to the special laws, instead of vice versa.
18. Retrospect.
The investigation of the external world in physics is a quest for
structure rather than substance. A structure can best be represented
as a complex of relations and relata; and in conformity with this we
endeavour to reduce the phenomena to their expressions in terms of the
relations which we call intervals and the relata which we call events.
If two bodies are of identical structure as regards the complex of
interval relations, they will be exactly similar as regards observational
properties†
, if our fundamental hypothesis is true. By this we show that
experimental measurements of lengths and duration are equivalent to
measurements of the interval relation.
∗The correct equations for a curved world will necessarily include as a special
case those already obtained for a flat world. The practical point on which we
seek the guidance of the Principle of Equivalence is whether the equations already
obtained for a flat world will serve as they stand or will require generalisation.
†At present this is limited to extensional properties (in both space and time). It
will be shown later that all mechanical properties are also included. Electromagnetic
properties require separate consideration.
ch. i retrospect 67
To the events we assign four identification-numbers or coordinates
according to a plan which is arbitrary within wide limits. The connection between our physical measurements of interval and the system of
identification-numbers is expressed by the general quadratic form (2.1).
In the particular case when these identification-numbers can be so assigned that the product terms in the quadratic form disappear leaving
only the four squares, the coordinates have the metrical properties belonging to rectangular coordinates and time, and are accordingly so
identified. If any such system exists an infinite number of others exist
connected with it by the Lorentz transformation, so that there is no
unique space-time frame. The relations of these different space-time
reckonings have been considered in detail. It is shown that there must
be a particular speed which has the remarkable property that its value
is the same for all these systems; and by appeal to the MichelsonMorley experiment or to Fizeau’s experiment it is found that this is a
distinctive property of the speed of light.
But it is not possible throughout the world to choose coordinates
fulfilling the current definitions of rectangular coordinates and time.
In such cases we usually relax the definitions, and attribute the failure of fulfilment to a field of force pervading the region. We have now
no definite guide in selecting what coordinates to take as rectangular
coordinates and time; for whatever the discrepancy, it can always be
ascribed to a suitable field of force. The field of force will vary according to the system of coordinates selected; but in the general case it is
not possible to get rid of it altogether (in a large region) by any choice
of coordinates. This irreducible field of force is ascribed to gravitation.
It should be noticed that the gravitational influence of a massive body
is not properly expressed by a definite field of force, but by the property of irreducibility of the field of force. We shall find later that the
irreducibility of the field of force is equivalent to what in geometrical
ch. i retrospect 68
nomenclature is called a curvature of the continuum of space-time.
For the fuller study of these problems we require a special mathematical calculus which will now be developed ab initio.

We have thus two varieties of vectors which we distinguish by the
upper or lower position of the suffix. The first illustration of a contravariant vector, dxµ, forms rather an awkward exception to the rule
that a lower suffix indicates covariance and an upper suffix contravariance. There is no other exception likely to mislead the reader, so that
it is not difficult to keep in mind this peculiarity of dxµ; but we shall
ch. ii the mathematical notion of a vector 71
sometimes find it convenient to indicate its contravariance explicitly by
writing
dxµ ≡ (dx)
µ
. (19.3)
A vector may either be a single set of four quantities associated with
a special point in space-time, or it may be a set of four functions varying
continuously with position. Thus we can have an “isolated vector” or
a “vector-field.”
For an illustration of a covariant vector we considered the gradient
of an invariant, ∂φ/∂xµ; but a covariant vector is not necessarily the
gradient of an invariant.
The reader will probably be already familiar with the term vector,
but the distinction of covariant and contravariant vectors will be new
to him. This is because in the elementary analysis only rectangular
coordinates are contemplated, and for transformations from one rectangular system to another the laws (19.1) and (19.2) are equivalent to
one another. From the geometrical point of view, the contravariant
vector is the vector with which everyone is familiar; this is because a
displacement, or directed distance between two points, is regarded as
representing (dx1, dx2, dx3)
∗ which, as we have seen, is contravariant.
The covariant vector is a new conception which does not so easily lend
itself to graphical illustration.
20. The mathematical notion of a vector.
The formal definitions in the preceding section do not help much
to an understanding of what the notion of a vector really is. We shall
try to explain this more fully, taking first the mathematical notion of
∗The customary resolution of a displacement into components in oblique directions assumes this.
ch. ii the mathematical notion of a vector 72
a vector (with which we are most directly concerned) and leaving the
more difficult physical notion to follow.
We have a set of four numbers (A1, A2, A3, A4) which we associate
with some point (x1, x2, x3, x4) and with a certain system of coordinates. We make a change of the coordinate-system, and we ask, What
will these numbers become in the new coordinates? The question is
meaningless; they do not automatically “become” anything. Unless we
interfere with them they stay as they were. But the mathematician
may say “When I am using the coordinates x1, x2, x3, x4, I want to
talk about the numbers A1, A2, A3, A4; and when I am using x
0
1
, x
0

4
, I find that at the corresponding stage of my work I shall want
to talk about four different numbers A0
1
, A0
2
, A0
3
, A0
4
. So for brevity I
propose to call both sets of numbers by the same symbol A.” We reply
“That will be all right, provided that you tell us just what numbers will
be denoted by A for each of the coordinate-systems you intend to use.
Unless you do this we shall not know what you are talking about.”
Accordingly the mathematician begins by giving us a list of the
numbers that A will signify in the different coordinate-systems. We
here denote these numbers by letters. A will mean∗
X, Y , Z for certain rectangular coordinates x, y, z,
R, Θ, Φ for certain polar coordinates r, θ, φ,
Λ, M, N for certain ellipsoidal coordinates λ, µ, ν.
“But,” says the mathematician, “I shall never finish at this rate. There
are an infinite number of coordinate-systems which I want to use. I see
that I must alter my plan. I will give you a general rule to find the new
values of A when you pass from one coordinate-system to another; so
∗For convenience I take a three-dimensional illustration.
ch. ii the mathematical notion of a vector 73
that it is only necessary for me to give you one set of values and you
can find all the others for yourselves.”
In mentioning a rule the mathematician gives up his arbitrary power
of making A mean anything according to his fancy at the moment. He
binds himself down to some kind of regularity. Indeed we might have
suspected that our orderly-minded friend would have some principle in
his assignment of different meanings to A. But even so, can we make
any guess at the rule he is likely to adopt unless we have some idea of
the problem he is working at in which A occurs? I think we can; it is not
necessary to know anything about the nature of his problem, whether
it relates to the world of physics or to something purely conceptual; it
is sufficient that we know a little about the nature of a mathematician.
What kind of rule could he adopt? Let us examine the quantities
which can enter into it. There are first the two sets of numbers to be
connected, say, X, Y , Z and R, Θ, Φ. Nothing has been said as to
these being analytical functions of any kind; so far as we know they
are isolated numbers. Therefore there can be no question of introducing their derivatives. They are regarded as located at some point of
space (x, y, z) and (r, θ, φ), otherwise the question of coordinates could
scarcely arise. They are changed because the coordinate-system has
changed at this point, and that change is defined by quantities like
∂r
∂x,
∂
2
θ
∂x ∂y , and so on. The integral coordinates themselves, x, y, z,
r, θ, φ, cannot be involved; because they express relations to a distant origin, whereas we are concerned only with changes at the spot
where (X, Y, Z) is located. Thus the rule must involve only the numbers X, Y , Z, R, Θ, Φ combined with the mutual derivatives of x, y, z,
r, θ, φ.

and amid the apparently infinite choice of formulae it will not be easy
to find others which have this self-consistency.
ch. ii the mathematical notion of a vector 75
The above rule is that already given for the contravariant vector (19.1). The rule for the covariant vector is also self-consistent.
There do not appear to be any other self-consistent rules for the transformation of a set of three numbers (or four numbers for four coordinates)∗
.
We see then that unless the mathematician disregards the need for
self-consistency in his rule, he must inevitably make his quantity A either a contravariant or a covariant vector. The choice between these
is entirely at his discretion. He might obtain a wider choice by disregarding the property of self-consistency—by selecting a particular
coordinate-system, x, y, z, and insisting that values in other coordinatesystems must always be obtained by applying the rule immediately to
X, Y , Z, and not permitting intermediate transformations. In practice
he does not do this, perhaps because he can never make up his mind
that any particular coordinates are deserving of this special distinction.
We see now that a mathematical vector is a common name for an
infinite number of sets of quantities, each set being associated with one
of an infinite number of systems of coordinates. The arbitrariness in the
association is removed by postulating that some method is followed, and
that no one system of coordinates is singled out for special distinction.
In technical language the transformations must form a Group. The
quantity (R, Θ, Φ) is in no sense the same quantity as (X, Y, Z); they
have a common name and a certain analytical connection, but the idea
∗Except that we may in addition multiply by any power of the Jacobian of the
transformation. This is self-consistent because
∂(x, y, z)
∂(r, θ, φ)
·
∂(r, θ, φ)
∂(λ, µ, ν)
=
∂(x, y, z)

.
Sets of numbers transformed with this additional multiplication are degenerate cases
of tensors of higher rank considered later. See §§ 48, 49.
ch. ii the physical notion of a vector 76
of anything like identity is entirely excluded from the mathematical
notion of a vector.
21. The physical notion of a vector.
The components of a force (X, Y, Z), (X0
, Y 0
, Z0
), etc. in different
systems of Cartesian coordinates, rectangular or oblique, form a contravariant vector. This is evident because in elementary mechanics a
force is resolved into components according to the parallelogram law
just as a displacement dxµ is resolved, and we have seen that dxµ is
a contravariant vector. So far as the mathematical notion of the vector is concerned, the quantities (X, Y, Z) and (X0
, Y 0
, Z0
) are not to
be regarded as in any way identical; but in physics we conceive that
both quantities express some kind of condition or relation of the world,
and this condition is the same whether expressed by (X, Y, Z) or by
(X0
, Y 0
, Z0
). The physical vector is this vaguely conceived entity, which
is independent of the coordinate-system, and is at the back of our measurements of force.
A world-condition cannot appear directly in a mathematical equation; only the measure of the world-condition can appear. Any number
or set of numbers which can serve to specify uniquely a condition of the
world may be called a measure of it. In using the phrase “condition of
the world” I intend to be as non-committal as possible; whatever in the
external world determines the values of the physical quantities which
we observe, will be included in the phrase.
The simplest case is when the condition of the world under consideration can be indicated by a single measure-number. Take two such
conditions underlying respectively the wave-length λ and period T of a
light-wave. We have the equation
λ = 3 · 1010 T. (21.1)
ch. ii the physical notion of a vector 77
This equation holds only for one particular plan of assigning measurenumbers (the c.g.s. system). But it may be written in the more general
form
λ = cT, (21.2)
where c is a velocity having the value 3 · 1010 in the c.g.s. system.
This comprises any number of particular equations of the form (21.1).
For each measure-plan, or system of units, c has a different numerical
value. The method of determining the necessary change of c when a new
measure-plan is adopted, is well known; we assign to it the dimensions
length ÷ time, and by a simple rule we know how it must be changed
when the units of λ and T are changed. For any general equation the
total dimensions of every term ought to be the same.
The tensor calculus extends this principle of dimensions to changes
of measure-code much more general than mere changes of units. There
are conditions of the world which cannot be specified by a single
measure-number; some require 4, some 16, some 64, etc., measurenumbers. Their variety is such that they cannot be arranged in a single
serial order. Consider then an equation between the measure-numbers
of two conditions of the world which require 4 measure-numbers. The
equation, if it is of the necessary general type, must hold for every
possible measure-code; this will be the case if, when we transform
the measure-code, both sides of the equation are transformed in the
same way, i.e. if we have to perform the same series of mathematical
operations on both sides.
We can here make use of the mathematical vector of § 20. Let our
equation in some measure-code be
A1, A2, A3, A4 = B1, B2, B3, B4. (21.3)
Now let us change the code so that the left-hand side becomes any four
numbers A0
1
, A0
2
, A0
3
, A0
4
. We identify this with the transformation of
ch. ii the physical notion of a vector 78
a covariant vector by associating with the change of measure-code the
corresponding transformation of coordinates from xµ to x
0
µ
as in (19.2).
But since (21.3) is to hold in all measure-codes, the transformation of
the right-hand side must involve the same set of operations; and the
change from B1, B2, B3, B4 to B0
1
, B0
2
, B0
3
, B0
4 will also be the transformation of a covariant vector associated with the same transformation
of coordinates from xµ to x
0
µ
.
We thus arrive at the result that in an equation which is independent of the measure-plan both sides must be covariant or both contravariant vectors. We shall extend this later to conditions expressed
by 16, 64, . . . , measure-numbers; the general rule is that both sides
of the equation must have the same elements of covariance and contravariance. Covariance and contravariance are a kind of generalised
dimension, showing how the measure of one condition of the world is
changed when the measure of another condition is changed. The ordinary theory of change of units is merely an elementary case of this.
Coordinates are the identification-numbers of the points of spacetime. There is no fundamental distinction between measure-numbers
and identification-numbers, so that we may regard the change of coordinates as part of the general change applied to all measure-numbers.
The change of coordinates no longer leads the way, as it did in § 20; it
is placed on the same level with the other changes of measure.
When we applied a change of measure-code to (21.3) we associated
with it a change of coordinates; but it is to be noted that the change
of coordinates was then ambiguous, since the two sides of the equation
might have been taken as both contravariant instead of both covariant; and further the change did not refer explicitly to coordinates in
the world—it was a mere entry in the mathematician’s note-book in
order that he might have the satisfaction of calling Aµ and Bµ vectors
consistently with his definition. Now if the measure-plan of a con-
ch. ii the physical notion of a vector 79
dition Aµ is changed the measures of other conditions and relations
associated with it will be changed. Among these is a certain relation
of two events which we may call the aspect ∗ of one from the other; and
this relation requires four measure-numbers to specify it. Somewhat
arbitrarily we decide to make the aspect a contravariant vector, and
the measure-numbers assigned to it are denoted by (dx)
µ
. That settles the ambiguity once for all. For obscure psychological reasons the
mind has singled out this transcendental relation of aspect for graphical representation, so that it is conceived by us as a displacement or
difference of location in a frame of space-time. Its measure-numbers
(dx)
µ are represented graphically as coordinate-differences dxµ, and so
for each measure-code of aspect we get a corresponding coordinateframe of location. This “real” coordinate-frame can now replace the
abstract frame in the mathematician’s note-book, because as we have
seen in (19.1) the actual transformation of coordinates resulting in a
change of dxµ is the same as the transformation associated with the
change of dxµ according to the law of a contravariant vector.
I do not think it is too extravagant to claim that the method of
the tensor calculus, which presents all physical equations in a form
independent of the choice of measure-code, is the only possible means of
studying the conditions of the world which are at the basis of physical
phenomena. The physicist is accustomed to insist (sometimes quite
unnecessarily) that all equations should be stated in a form independent
of the units employed. Whether this is desirable depends on the purpose
of the formulae. But whatever additional insight into underlying causes
is gained by stating equations in a form independent of units, must be
∗The relation of aspect (or in its graphical conception displacement) with
four measure-numbers seems to be derived from the relation of interval with one
measure-number, by taking account not only of the mutual interval between the
two events but also of their intervals from all surrounding events.
ch. ii the physical notion of a vector 80
gained to a far greater degree by stating them in a form altogether
independent of the measure-code. An equation of this general form is
called a tensor equation.
When the physicist is attacking the everyday problems of his subject, he may use any form of the equations—any specialised measureplan—which will shorten the labour of calculation; for in these problems he is concerned with the outward significance rather than the
inward significance of his formulae. But once in a while he turns to
consider their inward significance—to consider that relation of things
in the world-structure which is the origin of his formulae. The only intelligible idea we can form of such a structural relation is that it exists
between the world-conditions themselves and not between the measurenumbers of a particular code. A law of nature resolves itself into a
constant relation, or even an identity, of the two world-conditions to
which the different classes of observed quantities forming the two sides
of the equation are traceable. Such a constant relation independent of
measure-code is only to be expressed by a tensor equation.
It may be remarked that if we take a force (X, Y, Z) and transform
it to polar coordinates, whether as a covariant or a contravariant vector, in neither case do we obtain the quantities called polar components
in elementary mechanics. The latter are not in our view the true polar components; they are merely rectangular components in three new
directions, viz. radial and transverse. In general the elementary definitions of physical quantities do not contemplate other than rectangular
components, and they may need to be supplemented before we can decide whether the physical vector is covariant or contravariant. Thus
if we define force as “mass × acceleration,” the force turns out to be
contravariant; but if we define it by “work = force × displacement,”
the force is covariant. With the latter definition, however, we have to
abandon the method of resolution into oblique components adopted in
ch. ii the summation convention 81
elementary mechanics.
In what follows it is generally sufficient to confine attention to the
mathematical notion of a vector. Some idea of the physical notion will
probably give greater insight, but is not necessary for the formal proofs.
22. The summation convention.
We shall adopt the convention that whenever a literal suffix appears
twice in a term that term is to be summed for values of the suffix 1, 2,
3, 4. For example, (2.1) will be written
ds2 = gµν dxµ dxν (gνµ = gµν). (22.1)
Here, since µ and ν each appear twice, the summation
X
4
µ=1
X

ν=1
is indicated; and the result written out in full gives (2.1).
Again, in the equation
A
0
µ =
∂xα
∂x0
µ
Aα,
the summation on the right is with respect to α only (µ appearing only
once). The equation is equivalent to (19.2).
The convention is not merely an abbreviation but an immense aid to
the analysis, giving it an impetus which is nearly always in a profitable
direction. Summations occur in our investigations without waiting for
our tardy approval.
A useful rule may be noted—
ch. ii the summation convention 82
Any literal suffix appearing twice in a term is a dummy suffix, which
may be changed freely to any other letter not already appropriated in
that term. Two or more dummy suffixes can be interchanged∗
. For
example
gαβ
∂
2xα
∂x0
µ ∂x0

∂x0
µ ∂x0
ν
∂xα
∂x0

(22.2)
by interchanging the dummy suffixes α and β, remembering that
gβα = gαβ.
For a further illustration we shall prove that
∂xµ
∂x0

∂xν

∂xµ

which by the usual theory gives the change dxµ consequent on a
change dxν. But xµ and xν are coordinates of the same system, so that
their variations are independent; hence dxµ is zero unless xµ and xν
are the same coordinate, in which case, of course, dxµ = dxν. Thus the
theorem is proved.
The multiplier ∂xµ
∂x0
α
∂x0
α

acts as a substitution-operator. That is to
say if A(µ) is any expression involving the suffix µ
∂xµ

∂xν
A(µ) = A(ν). (22.4)
∗At first we shall call attention to such changes when we employ them; but the
reader will be expected gradually to become familiar with the device as a common
process of manipulation.
ch. ii tensors 83
For on the left the summation with respect to µ gives four terms corresponding to the values 1, 2, 3, 4 of µ. One of these values will agree
with ν. Denote the other three values by σ, τ , ρ. Then by (22.3) the
result is
1·A(ν) + 0 · A(σ) + 0 · A(τ ) + 0 · A(ρ)
= A(ν).
The multiplier accordingly has the effect of substituting ν for µ in the
multiplicand.
23. Tensors.
The two laws of transformation given in § 19 are now written—
Contravariant vectors

Covariant vectors

We can denote by Aµν a quantity with 16 components obtained by
giving µ and ν the values from 1 to 4 independently. Similarly Aµνσ has
64 components. By a generalisation of the foregoing transformation
laws we classify quantities of this kind as follows—
Contravariant tensors
A
0µν =

The above are called tensors of the second rank. We have similar laws
for tensors of higher ranks. E.g.

∂xβ
∂x0
ν
∂xγ

αβγ. (23.3)
It may be worth while to remind the reader that (23.3) typifies 256 distinct equations each with a sum of 256 terms on the right-hand side.
It is easily shown that these transformation laws fulfil the condition of self-consistency explained in § 20, and it is for this reason that
quantities governed by them are selected for special nomenclature.
If a tensor vanishes, i.e. if all its components vanish, in one system
of coordinates, it will continue to vanish when any other system of
coordinates is substituted. This is clear from the linearity of the above
transformation laws.
Evidently the sum of two tensors of the same covariant or contravariant character is a tensor. Hence a law expressed by the vanishing of
the sum of a number of tensors, or by the equality of two tensors of the
same kind, will be independent of the coordinate-system used.
The product of two tensors such as Aµν and Bτ
σ
is a tensor of the
character indicated by Aτ
µνσ. This is proved by showing that the transformation law of the product is the same as (23.3).
ch. ii inner multiplication and contraction 85
The general term tensor includes vectors (tensors of the first rank)
and invariants or scalars∗
(tensors of zero rank).
A tensor of the second or higher rank need not be expressible as a
product of two tensors of lower rank.
A simple example of an expression of the second rank is afforded
by the stresses in a solid or viscous fluid. The component of stress
denoted by pxy is the traction in the y-direction across an interface
perpendicular to the x-direction. Each component is thus associated
with two directions.
24. Inner multiplication and contraction. The quotient
law.
If we multiply Aµ by Bν we obtain sixteen quantities A1B1
, A1B2
,
A2B1
, . . . constituting a mixed tensor. Suppose that we wish to consider the four “diagonal” terms A1B1
, A2B2
, A3B3
, A4B4
; we naturally
try to abbreviate these by writing them AµBµ
. But by the summation
convention AµBµ
stands for the sum of the four quantities. The convention is right. We have no use for them individually since they do
not form a vector; but the sum is of great importance.
AµBµ
is called the inner product of the two vectors, in contrast to
the ordinary or outer product AµBν
.
In rectangular coordinates the inner product coincides with the
scalar-product defined in the well-known elementary theory of vectors;
but the outer product is not the so-called vector-product of the elementary theory.
By a similar process we can form from any mixed tensor Aτ
µνσ a
∗Scalar is a synonym for invariant. I generally use the latter word as the more
self-explanatory.
ch. ii inner multiplication and contraction 86
“contracted∗”tensor Aσ
µνσ, which is two ranks lower since σ has now
become a dummy suffix. To prove that Aσ
µνσ is a tensor, we set τ = σ
in (23.3),
A
0σ
µνσ =

Hence

Comparing with the transformation law (23.22) we see that Aσ
µνσ is a
covariant tensor of the second rank. Of course, the dummy suffixes γ
and σ are equivalent.
Similarly, setting ν = µ in (23.23),

A
β

that is to say Aµ
µ
is unaltered by a transformation of coordinates. Hence
it is an invariant.
By the same method we can show that AµBµ
, Aµν
µν, Aν
µBµ
ν
are invariants. In general when an upper and lower suffix are the same the
corresponding covariant and contravariant qualities cancel out. If all
suffixes cancel out in this way, the expression must be invariant. The
identified suffixes must be of opposite characters; the expression Aτ
µσσ
is not a tensor, and no interest is attached to it.
We see that the suffixes keep a tally of what we have called the
generalised dimensions of the terms in our equations. After cancelling
∗German, verj¨ungt.
ch. ii inner multiplication and contraction 87
out any suffixes which appear in both upper and lower positions, the
remaining suffixes must appear in the same position in each term of
an equation. When that is satisfied each term will undergo the same
set of operations when a transformation of coordinates is made, and
the equation will continue to hold in all systems of coordinates. This
may be compared with the well-known condition that each term must
have the same physical dimensions, so that it undergoes multiplication
by the same factor when a change of units is made and the equation
continues to hold in all systems of units.
Just as we can infer the physical dimensions of some novel entity
entering into a physical equation, so we can infer the contravariant and
covariant dimensions of an expression whose character was hitherto
unknown. For example, if the equation is
A(µν)Bνσ = Cµσ, (24.1)
where the nature of A(µν) is not known initially, we see that A(µν) must
be a tensor of the character Aν
µ
, so as to give
A
ν
µBνσ = Cµσ,
which makes the covariant dimensions on both sides consistent.
The equation (24.1) may be written symbolically
A(µν) = Cµσ/Bνσ,
and the conclusion is that not only the product but also the (symbolic) quotient of two tensors is a tensor. Of course, the operation here
indicated is not that of ordinary division.
This quotient law is a useful aid in detecting the tensor-character
of expressions. It is not claimed that the general argument here given
ch. ii the fundamental tensors 88
amounts to a strict mathematical proof. In most cases we can supply
the proof required by one or more applications of the following rigorous
theorem—
A quantity which on inner multiplication by any covariant (alternatively, by any contravariant) vector always gives a tensor, is itself a
tensor.
For suppose that
A(µν)B
ν
is always a covariant vector for any choice of the contravariant vector Bν
. Then by (23.12)
{A

Since B0ν
is arbitrary the quantity in the bracket must vanish. This
shows that A(µν) is a covariant tensor obeying the transformation
law (23.22).
We shall cite this theorem as the “rigorous quotient theorem.”
25. The fundamental tensors.
It is convenient to write (22.1) as
ds2 = gµν(dx)
µ
(dx)
ν
ch. ii the fundamental tensors 89
in order to show explicitly the contravariant character of dxµ = (dx)
µ
.
Since ds2
is independent of the coordinate-system it is an invariant or
tensor of zero rank. The equation shows that gµν(dx)
µ multiplied by an
arbitrarily chosen contravariant vector (dx)
ν always gives a tensor of
zero rank; hence gµν(dx)
µ
is a vector. Again, we see that gµν multiplied
by an arbitrary contravariant vector (dx)
µ always gives a vector; hence
gµν is a tensor. This double application of the rigorous quotient theorem
shows that gµν is a tensor; and it is evidently covariant as the notation
has anticipated.
Let g stand for the determinant

.
Let g
µν be defined as the minor of gµν in this determinant, divided
by g
∗
.
Consider the inner product gµσg
νσ. We see that µ and ν select two
rows in the determinant; we have to take each element in turn from
the µ row, multiply by the minor of the corresponding element of the
ν row, add together, and divide the result by g. This is equivalent to
substituting the µ row for the ν row and dividing the resulting determinant by g. If µ is not the same as ν this gives a determinant with two
rows identical, and the result is 0. If µ is the same as ν we reproduce
∗The notation anticipates the result proved later that g

ch. ii the fundamental tensors 90
the determinant g divided by itself, and the result is 1. We write
g
ν
µ = gµσg
νσ



. (25.1)
Thus g
ν
µ has the same property of a substitution-operator that we
found for ∂xµ
∂x0

in (22.4). For example∗
,
g
ν
µA
µ = A
ν + 0 + 0 + 0. (25.2)
Note that g
µ
ν has not the same meaning as g
ν
µ with µ = ν, because
a summation is implied. Evidently
g
ν
ν = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4. (25.3)
The equation (25.2) shows that g
ν
µ multiplied by any contravariant vector always gives a vector. Hence g
ν
µ
is a tensor. It is a very
exceptional tensor since its components are the same in all coordinatesystems.
Again since gµσg
νσ is a tensor we can infer that g
νσ is a tensor.
This is proved rigorously by remarking that gµσAµ
is a covariant vector,
arbitrary on account of the free choice of Aµ
. Multiplying this vector
by g
νσ we have
gµσg
νσA
µ = g
ν
µA
µ = A
ν
,
so that the product is always a vector. Hence the rigorous quotient
theorem applies.
∗Note that g
ν
µ will act as a substitution-operator on any expression and is not
restricted to operating on tensors.
ch. ii associated tensors 91
The tensor character of g
µν may also be demonstrated by a method
which shows more clearly the reason for its definition as the minor of gµν
divided by g. Since gµνAν
is a covariant vector, we can denote it by Bµ.
Thus
g11A
1 + g12A
2 + g13A
3 + g14A
4 = B1; etc.
Solving these four linear equations for A1
, A2
, A3
, A4 by the usual
method of determinants, the result is
A
1 = g
11B1 + g
12B2 + g
13B3 + g
14B4; etc.,
so that
A
µ = g
µνBν.
Whence by the rigorous quotient theorem g
µν is a tensor.
We have thus defined three fundamental tensors
gµν, gν
µ
, gµν
of covariant, mixed, and contravariant characters respectively.
26. Associated tensors.
We now define the operation of raising or lowering a suffix. Raising
the suffix of a vector is defined by the equation
A
µ = g
µνAν,
and lowering by the equation
Aµ = gµνA
ν
.
ch. ii associated tensors 92
For a more general tensor such as A
γδ
αβµ, the operation of raising µ is
defined in the same way, viz.
A
γδµ
αβ = g
µνA
γδ
αβν, (26.1)
and for lowering
A
γδ
αβµ = gµνA
γδν
αβ . (26.2)
These definitions are consistent, since if we raise a suffix and then
lower it we reproduce the original tensor. Thus if in (26.1) we multiply
by gµσ in order to lower the suffix on the left, we have
gµσA
γδµ
αβ = gµσg
µνA

which is the rule expressed by (26.2).
It will be noticed that the raising of a suffix ν by means of g
µν is
accompanied by the substitution of µ for ν. The whole operation is
closely akin to the plain substitution of µ for ν by means of g
ν
µ
. Thus
multiplication by g
µν gives substitution with raising,
multiplication by g
ν
µ
gives plain substitution,
multiplication by gµν gives substitution with lowering.
In the case of non-symmetrical tensors it may be necessary to distinguish the place from which the raised suffix has been brought, e.g.
to distinguish between Aµ
ν
and Aν
µ.
It is easily seen that this rule of association between tensors with
suffixes in different positions is fulfilled in the case of g
µν
, g

µ
, gµν; in
fact the definition of g

µ
in (25.1) is a special case of (26.1).
ch. ii associated tensors 93
For rectangular coordinates the raising or lowering of a suffix leaves
the components unaltered in three-dimensional space∗
; and it merely
reverses the signs of some of the components for Galilean coordinates in
four-dimensional space-time. Since the elementary definitions of physical quantities refer to rectangular axes and time, we can generally
use any one of the associated tensors to represent a physical entity
without infringing pre-relativity definitions. This leads to a somewhat
enlarged view of a tensor as having in itself no particular covariant or
contravariant character, but having components of various degrees of
covariance or contravariance represented by the whole system of associated tensors. That is to say, the raising or lowering of suffixes will not
be regarded as altering the individuality of the tensor; and reference
to a tensor Aµν may (if the context permits) be taken to include the
associated tensors Aν
µ
and Aµν
.
It is useful to notice that dummy suffixes have a certain freedom of
movement between the tensor-factors of an expression. Thus
AαβB
αβ = A
αβBαβ, AµαB
να = Aµ

The suffix may be raised in one term provided it is lowered in the other.
The proof follows easily from (26.1) and (26.2).
In the elementary vector theory two vectors are said to be perpendicular if their scalar-product vanishes; and the square of the length
of the vector is its scalar-product into itself. Corresponding definitions
are adopted in the tensor calculus.
The vectors Aµ and Bµ are said to be perpendicular if
AµB
µ = 0. (26.4)

If l is the length of Aµ (or Aµ
)

A vector is self-perpendicular if its length vanishes.
The interval is the length of the corresponding displacement dxµ
because
ds2 = gµν (dx)
µ
· (dx)
ν
= (dx)ν(dx)
ν
by (26.2). A displacement is thus self-perpendicular when it is along a
light-track, ds = 0.
If a vector Aµ receives an infinitesimal increment dAµ perpendicular
to itself, its length is unaltered to the first order; for by (26.5)
(l + dl)
2 = (Aµ + dAµ)(A
µ + dAµ
)
= AµA

µ
dAµ + Aµ dAµ
to the first order
= l
2 + 2Aµ dAµ
by (26.3),
and Aµ dAµ = 0 by the condition of perpendicularity (26.4).
In the elementary vector theory, the scalar-product of two vectors
is equal to the product of their lengths multiplied by the cosine of the
angle between them. Accordingly in the general theory the angle θ
between two vectors Aµ and Bµ is defined by
cos θ =
AµBµ
p
(AαAα)(BβBβ)
. (26.6)
Clearly the angle so defined is an invariant, and agrees with the usual
definition when the coordinates are rectangular. In determining the
ch. ii christoffel’s 3-index symbols 95
angle between two intersecting lines it makes no difference whether the
world is curved or flat, since only the initial directions are concerned
and these in any case lie in the tangent plane. The angle θ (if it is real)
has thus the usual geometrical meaning even in non-Euclidean space.
It must not, however, be inferred that ordinary angles are invariant for
the Lorentz transformation; naturally an angle in three dimensions is
invariant only for transformations in three dimensions, and the angle
which is invariant for Lorentz transformations is a four-dimensional
angle.
From a tensor of even rank we can construct an invariant by bringing half the suffixes to the upper and half to the lower position and
contracting. Thus from Aµνστ we form Aστ
µν and contract, obtaining
A = Aµν
µν. This invariant will be called the spur ∗
. Another invariant is
the square of the length AµνστAµνστ . There may also be intermediate
invariants such as Aα
µναA
µνβ
β
.

The result (27.3) is obvious from the definitions. To prove (27.4), multiply (27.3) by gσα; then
gσα {µν, σ} = gσαg
σλ [µν, λ]
= g
λ

[µν, λ]
= [µν, α],
which is equivalent to (27.4).
Comparing with (26.1) and (26.2) we see that the passage from the
“square” to the “curly” symbol, and vice versa, is the same process as
raising and lowering a suffix. It might be convenient to use a notation
in which this was made evident, e.g.
Γµν,σ = [µν, σ], Γ
σ
µν = {µν, σ},
but we shall adhere to the more usual notation.
From (27.1) it is found that
[µν, σ] + [σν, µ] = ∂gµσ
∂xν
. (27.5)
There are 40 different 3-index symbols of each kind. It may here be
explained that the gµν are components of a generalised potential, and
the 3-index symbols components of a generalised force in the gravitational theory (see § 55).
28. Equations of a geodesic.
We shall now determine the equations of a geodesic or path between
two points for which
Z
ds is stationary.
ch. ii equations of a geodesic 97
This absolute track is of fundamental importance in dynamics, but at
the moment we are concerned with it only as an aid in the development
of the tensor calculus∗
.
Keeping the beginning and end of the path fixed, we give every
intermediate point an arbitrary infinitesimal displacement δxσ so as to
deform the path. Since
ds2 = gµν dxµ dxν,
2 ds δ(ds) = dxµ dxν δgµν + gµν dxµ δ(dxν) + gµν dxν δ(dxµ)

∗These simple formulae are noteworthy as illustrating the great value of the
summation convention. The law of total differentiation for four coordinates becomes
formally the same as for one coordinate.
ch. ii covariant derivative of a vector 99
29. Covariant derivative of a vector.
The derivative of an invariant is a covariant vector (§ 19), but the
derivative of a vector is not a tensor. We proceed to find certain tensors
which are used in this calculus in place of the ordinary derivatives of
vectors.
Since dxµ is contravariant and ds invariant, a “velocity” dxµ/ds is
a contravariant vector. Hence if Aµ is any covariant vector the inner
product
Aµ
dxµ
ds is invariant.
The rate of change of this expression per unit interval along any assigned curve must also be independent of the coordinate-system, i.e.
d
ds 
Aµ
dxµ
ds 
is invariant. (29.1)
This assumes that we keep to the same absolute curve however the
coordinate-system is varied. The result (29.1) is therefore only of practical use if it is applied to a curve which is defined independently of
the coordinate-system. We shall accordingly apply it to a geodesic.
Performing the differentiation,
∂Aµ
∂xν
dxν
ds
dxµ
ds + Aµ

is invariant along a geodesic. (29.2)
From (28.5) we have that along a geodesic

ds2
= Aα

Hence (29.2) gives

∂Aµ

is invariant.
ch. ii covariant derivative of a vector 100
The result is now general since the curvature (which distinguishes the
geodesic) has been eliminated by using the equations (28.5) and only
the gradient of the curve (dxµ/ds and dxν/ds) has been left in the
expression.
Since dxµ/ds and dxν/ds are contravariant vectors, their co-factor
is a covariant tensor of the second rank. We therefore write
Aµν =
∂Aµ
∂xν
− {µν, α} Aα, (29.3)
and the tensor Aµν is called the covariant derivative of Aµ.
By raising a suffix we obtain two associated tensors Aµ
ν and Aµ
ν
which must be distinguished since the two suffixes are not symmetrical. The first of these is the most important, and is to be understood
when the tensor is written simply as Aµ
ν without distinction of original
position.
Since
Aσ = gσA

,
we have by (29.3)
Aσν =
∂

(gσA

Hence multiplying through by g

A

. (29.4)
ch. ii covariant derivative of a tensor 101
This is called the covariant derivative of Aµ
. The considerable differences between the formulae (29.3) and (29.4) should be carefully noted.
The tensors Aµ
ν
and Aµν, obtained from (29.3) and (29.4) by raising
the second suffix, are called the contravariant derivatives of Aµ and Aµ
.
We shall not have much occasion to refer to contravariant derivatives.
30. Covariant derivative of a tensor.
The covariant derivatives of tensors of the second rank are formed
as follows—
A
µν
σ =
∂Aµν
∂xσ
+ {ασ, µ} A
αν + {ασ, ν} A
µα

A

α
µ
, (30.2)
Aµνσ =
∂Aµν
∂xσ
− {µσ, α} Aαν − {νσ, α} Aµα. (30.3)
And the general rule for covariant differentiation with respect to xσ is
illustrated by the example
A
ρ
λµνσ =
∂
∂xσ
A
ρ
λµν − {λσ, α} A
ρ
αµν − {µσ, α} A
ρ
λαν
− {νσ, α} A
ρ
λµα + {ασ, ρ} A
α
λµν. (30.4)
The above formulae are primarily definitions; but we have to prove
that the quantities on the right are actually tensors. This is done by
an obvious generalisation of the method of the preceding section. Thus
if in place of (29.1) we use
d
ds 
Aµν

Then substituting for the second derivatives from (28.5) the expression
reduces to
Aµνσ
dxµ
ds
dxν
ds
dxσ
ds is invariant,
showing that Aµνσ is a tensor.
The formulae (30.1) and (30.2) are obtained by raising the suffixes
ν and µ, the details of the work being the same as in deducing (29.4)
from (29.3).
Consider the expression
BµσCν + BµCνσ,
the σ denoting covariant differentiation. By (29.3) this is equal to

∂Bµ
∂xσ
− {µσ, α} Bα

Cν + Bµ

∂Cν

− {νσ, α} Cα

=
∂
∂xσ
(BµCν) − {µσ, α} (BαCν) − {νσ, α} (BµCα).
But comparing with (30.3) we see that this is the covariant derivative
of the tensor of the second rank (BµCν). Hence
(BµCν)σ = BµσCν + BµCνσ. (30.5)
Thus in covariant differentiation of a product the distributive rule used
in ordinary differentiation holds good.
ch. ii covariant derivative of a tensor 103
Applying (30.3) to the fundamental tensor, we have
gµνσ =
∂gµν
∂xσ
− {µσ, ν} gαν − {νσ, α} gµα
=
∂gµν
∂xσ
− [µσ, ν] − [νσ, µ]
= 0 by (27.5).
Hence the covariant derivatives of the fundamental tensors vanish
identically, and the fundamental tensors can be treated as constants
in covariant differentiation. It is thus immaterial whether a suffix is
raised before or after the differentiation, as our definitions have already
postulated.
If I is an invariant, IAµ is a covariant vector; hence its covariant
derivative is
(IAµ)ν =
∂
∂xν
(IAµ) − {µν, α} IAα
= Aµ
∂I
∂xν
+ IAµν.
But by the rule for differentiating a product (30.5)
(IAµ)ν = IνAµ + IAµν,
so that
Iν =
∂I
∂xν
.
Hence the covariant derivative of an invariant is the same as its ordinary
derivative.
It is, of course, impossible to reserve the notation Aµν exclusively
for the covariant derivative of Aµ, and the concluding suffix does not
ch. ii covariant derivative of a tensor 104
denote differentiation unless expressly stated. In case of doubt we may
indicate the covariant and contravariant derivatives by (Aµ)ν and (Aµ)
ν
.
The utility of the covariant derivative arises largely from the fact
that, when the gµν are constants, the 3-index symbols vanish and the
covariant derivative reduces to the ordinary derivative. Now in general
our physical equations have been stated for the case of Galilean coordinates in which the gµν are constants; and we may in Galilean equations
replace the ordinary derivative by the covariant derivative without altering anything. This is a necessary step in reducing such equations to
the general tensor form which holds true for all coordinate-systems.
As an illustration suppose we wish to find the general equation
of propagation of a potential with the velocity of light. In Galilean
coordinates the equation is of the well-known form
φ =
∂
2φ
∂t2
−
∂
2φ
∂x2
−
∂
2φ

The Galilean values of g
µν are g
44 = 1, g
11 = g
22 = g
33 = −1, and
the other components vanish. Hence (30.6) can be written
g
µν ∂
2φ
∂xµ ∂xν
= 0. (30.65)
The potential φ being an invariant, its ordinary derivative is a covariant vector φµ = ∂φ/∂xµ; and since the coordinates are Galilean we
may insert the covariant derivative φµν instead of ∂φµ/∂xν. Hence the
equation becomes
g
µνφµν = 0. (30.7)
Up to this point Galilean coordinates are essential; but now, by examining the covariant dimensions of (30.7), we notice that the left-hand
ch. ii covariant derivative of a tensor 105
side is an invariant, and therefore its value is unchanged by any transformation of coordinates. Hence (30.7) holds for all coordinate-systems,
if it holds for any. Using (29.3) we can write it more fully
g
µν 
∂
2φ
∂xµ ∂xν
− {µν, α}
∂φ
∂xα

= 0. (30.8)
This formula may be used for transforming Laplace’s equation into
curvilinear coordinates, etc.
It must be remembered that a transformation of coordinates does
not alter the kind of space. Thus if we know by experiment that a
potential φ is propagated according to the law (30.6) in Galilean coordinates, it follows rigorously that it is propagated according to the
law (30.8) in any system of coordinates in flat space-time; but it does
not follow rigorously that it will be propagated according to (30.8)
when an irreducible gravitational field is present which alters the kind
of space-time. It is, however, a plausible suggestion that (30.8) may be
the general law of propagation of φ in any kind of space-time; that is
the suggestion which the principle of equivalence makes. Like all generalisations which are only tested experimentally in a particular case,
it must be received with caution.
The operator  will frequently be referred to. In general coordinates
it is to be taken as defined by
Aµν··· = g
αβ(Aµν···)αβ. (30.9)

A tensor of the second or higher rank may be taken instead of Aµ
in (31.4), and its covariant derivative will be found by the same method.
32. Surface-elements and Stokes’s theorem.
Consider the outer product Σµν of two different displacements dxµ
and δxν. The tensor Σµν will be unsymmetrical in µ and ν. We
can decompose any such tensor into the sum of a symmetrical part
1
2
(Σµν + Σνµ) and an antisymmetrical part 1
2
(Σµν − Σ
νµ).
Double∗
the antisymmetrical part of the product dxµ δxν is called
the surface-element contained by the two displacements, and is denoted
by dSµν. We have accordingly
dSµν = dxµ δxν − dxν δxµ (32.1)
=




dxµ dxν
δxµ δxν




.
In rectangular coordinates this determinant represents the area of the
projection on the µν plane of the parallelogram contained by the two
displacements; thus the components of the tensor are the projections
of the parallelogram on the six coordinate planes. In the tensor dSµν
these are repeated twice, once with positive and once with negative
sign (corresponding perhaps to the two sides of the surface). The four
components dS11
, dS22, etc. vanish, as must happen in every antisymmetrical tensor. The appropriateness of the name “surface-element” is
evident in rectangular coordinates; the geometrical meaning becomes
more obscure in other systems.
∗The doubling of the natural expression is avenged by the appearance of the
factor 1
2
in most formulae containing dSµν
.
ch. ii surface-elements and stokes’s theorem 110
The surface-element is always a tensor of the second rank whatever
the number of dimensions of space; but in three dimensions there is an
alternative representation of a surface area by a simple vector at right
angles to the surface and of length proportional to the area; indeed it is
customary in three dimensions to represent any antisymmetrical tensor
by an adjoint vector. Happily in four dimensions it is not possible to
introduce this source of confusion.
The invariant
1
2Aµν dSµν
is called the flux of the tensor Aµν through the surface-element. The
flux involves only the antisymmetrical part of Aµν, since the inner product of a symmetrical and an antisymmetrical tensor evidently vanishes.
Some of the chief antisymmetrical tensors arise from the operation
of curling. If Kµν is the covariant derivative of Kµ, we find from (29.3)
that
Kµν − Kνµ =
∂Kµ
∂xν
−
∂Kν
∂xµ
(32.2)
since the 3-index symbols cancel out. Since the left-hand side is a
tensor, the right-hand side is also a tensor. The right-hand side will
be recognised as the “curl” of elementary vector theory, except that
we have apparently reversed the sign. Strictly speaking, however, we
should note that the curl in the elementary three-dimensional theory
is a vector, whereas our curl is a tensor; and comparison of the sign
attributed is impossible.
The result that the covariant curl is the same as the ordinary curl
does not apply to contravariant vectors or to tensors of higher rank:

the double integral being taken over any surface bounded by the path of

is needed because each surface-element
occurs twice, e.g. as dS12 and −dS21. The theorem can be proved as
follows—
Since both sides of the equation are invariants it is sufficient to prove
the equation for any one system of coordinates. Choose coordinates so
that the surface is on one of the fundamental partitions x2 = const.,
x4 = const., and so that the contour consists of four parts given successively by x1 = α, x2 = β, x1 = γ, x2 = δ; the rest of the mesh-system
may be filled up arbitrarily. For an elementary mesh the containing
vectors are (dx1, 0, 0, 0) and (0, dx2, 0, 0), so that by (32.1)
dS12 = dx1 dx2 = −dS21

which consists of four terms giving R

This proof affords a good illustration of the methods of the tensor calculus. The relation to be established is between two quantities
which (by examination of their covariant dimensions) are seen to be
ch. ii significance of covariant differentiation 112
invariants, viz. Kµ(dx)
µ and (Kµν − Kνµ) dSµν, the latter having been
simplified by (32.2). Accordingly it is a relation which does not depend on any particular choice of coordinates, although in (32.3) it is
expressed as it would appear when referred to a coordinate-system. In
proving the relation of the two invariants once for all, we naturally
choose for the occasion coordinates which simplify the analysis; and
the work is greatly shortened by drawing our curved meshes so that
four partition-lines make up the contour.
33. Significance of covariant differentiation.
Suppose that we wish to discuss from the physical point of view how
a field of force varies from point to point. If polar coordinates are being
used, a change of the r-component does not necessarily indicate a want
of uniformity in the field of force; it is at least partly attributable to the
inclination between the r-directions at different points. Similarly when
rotating axes are used, the rate of change of momentum h is given not
by dh1/dt, etc., but by
dh1/dt − ω3/h2 + ω2/h3, etc. (33.1)
The momentum may be constant even when the time-derivatives of its
components are not zero.
We must recognise then that the change of a physical entity is usually regarded as something distinct from the change of the mathematical
components into which we resolve it. In the elementary theory a definition of the former change is obtained by identifying it with the change
of the components in unaccelerated rectangular coordinates; but this is
of no avail in the general case because space-time may be of a kind for
which no such coordinates exist. Can we still preserve this notion of a
physical rate of change in the general case?
ch. ii significance of covariant differentiation 113
Our attention is directed to the rate of change of a physical entity
because of its importance in the laws of physics, e.g. force is the timerate of change of momentum, or the space-rate of change of potential;
therefore the rate of change should be expressed by a tensor of some
kind in order that it may enter into the general physical laws. Further
in order to agree with the customary definition in elementary cases, it
must reduce to the rate of change of the rectangular components when
the coordinates are Galilean. Both conditions are fulfilled if we define
the physical rate of change of the tensor by its covariant derivative.
The covariant derivative Aµν consists of the term ∂Aµ/dxν, giving
the apparent gradient, from which is subtracted the “spurious change”
{µν, α} Aα attributable to the curvilinearity of the coordinate-system.
When Cartesian coordinates (rectangular or oblique) are used, the 3-
index symbols vanish and there is, as we should expect, no spurious
change. For the present we shall call Aµν the rate of absolute change
of the vector Aµ.
Consider an elementary mesh in the plane of xνxσ, the corners being
at
A(xν, xσ), B(xν+dxν, xσ), C(xν+dxν, xσ+dxσ), D(xν, xσ+dxσ).
Let us calculate the whole absolute change of the vector-field Aµ as we
pass round the circuit ABCDA.
(1) From A to B, the absolute change is Aµν dxν, calculated
for xσ
∗
.
(2) From B to C, the absolute change is Aµσ dxσ, calculated
for xν + dxν.
∗We suspend the summation convention since dxν and dxσ are edges of a particular mesh. The convention would give correct results; but it goes too fast, and
we cannot keep pace with it.
ch. ii significance of covariant differentiation 114
(3) From C to D, the absolute change is −Aµν dxν, calculated
for xσ + dxσ.
(4) From D to A, the absolute change is −Aµσ dxσ, calculated for xν.
Combining (2) and (4) the net result is the difference of the changes
Aµσ dxσ, at xν + dxν and at xν respectively. We might be tempted to
set this difference down as
∂
∂xν
(Aµν dxσ) dxν.
But as already explained that would give only the difference of the
mathematical components and not the “absolute difference.” We must
take the covariant derivative instead, obtaining (since dxσ is the same
for (2) and (4))
Aµσν dxσ dxν.
Similarly (3) and (1) give
−Aµνσ dxν dxσ,
so that the total absolute change round the circuit is
(Aµσν − Aµνσ) dxν dxσ. (33.2)
We should naturally expect that on returning to our starting point
the absolute change would vanish. How could there have been any
absolute change on balance, seeing that the vector is now the same Aµ
that we started with? Nevertheless in general Aµνσ 6= Aµσν, that is to
say the order of covariant differentiation is not permutable, and (33.2)
does not vanish.
That this result is not unreasonable may be seen by considering a
two-dimensional space, the surface of the ocean. If a ship’s head is
ch. ii significance of covariant differentiation 115
kept straight on the line of its wake, the course is a great circle. Now
suppose that the ship sails round a circuit so that the final position
and course are the same as at the start. If account is kept of all the
successive changes of course, and the angles are added up, these will
not give a change zero (or 2π) on balance. For a triangular course the
difference is the well-known “spherical excess.” Similarly the changes
of velocity do not cancel out on balance. Here we have an illustration
that the absolute changes of a vector do not cancel out on bringing it
back to its initial position.
If the present result sounds self-contradictory, the fault lies with the
name “absolute change” which we have tentatively applied to the thing
under discussion. The name is illuminating in some respects, because
it shows the continuity of covariant differentiation with the conceptions
of elementary physics. For instance, no one would hesitate to call (33.1)
the absolute rate of change of momentum in contrast to the apparent
rate of change dh1/dt. But having shown the continuity, we find it
better to avoid the term in the more general case of non-Euclidean
space.
Following Levi-Civita and Weyl we use the term parallel displacement for what we have hitherto called displacement without “absolute
change.” The condition for parallel displacement is that the covariant
derivative vanishes.
We have hitherto considered the absolute change necessary in order
that the vector may return to its original value, and so be a singlevalued function of position. If we do not permit any change en route,
i.e. if we move the vector by parallel displacement, the same quantity
will appear (with reversed sign) as a discrepancy δAµ between the final
and initial vectors. Since these are at the same point the difference of
the initial and final vectors can be measured immediately. We have
ch. ii significance of covariant differentiation 116
then by (33.2)
δAµ = (Aµνσ − Aµσν) dxν dxσ,
which may also be written
δAµ =
1
2
Z Z (Aµνσ − Aµσν) dSνσ
, (33.3)
where the summation convention is now restored. We have only proved
this for an infinitesimal circuit occupying a coordinate-mesh, for which
dSµν has only two non-vanishing components dxν dxσ and −dxν dxσ.
But the equation is seen to be a tensor-equation, and therefore holds
independently of the coordinate-system; thus it applies to circuits of
any shape, since we can always choose coordinates for which the circuit
becomes a coordinate-mesh. But (33.3) is still restricted to infinitesimal
circuits and there is no way of extending it to finite circuits—unlike
Stokes’s theorem. The reason for this restriction is as follows—
An isolated vector Aµ may be taken at the starting point and carried
by parallel displacement round the circuit, leading to a determinate
value of δAµ. In (33.3) this is expressed in terms of derivatives of a
vector-field Aµ extending throughout the region of integration. For a
large circuit this would involve values of Aµ remote from the initial
vector, which are obviously irrelevant to the calculation of δAµ. It is
rather remarkable that there should exist such a formula even for an
infinitesimal circuit; the fact is that although Aµνσ − Aµσν at a point
formally refers to a vector-field, its value turns out to depend solely on
the isolated vector Aµ (see equation (34.3)).
The contravariant vector dxµ/ds gives a direction in the fourdimensional world which is interpreted as a velocity from the ordinary
point of view which separates space and time. We shall usually call
it a “velocity”; its connection with the usual three-dimensional vector
ch. ii the riemann-christoffel tensor 117
(u, v, w) is given by
dxµ
ds = β(u, v, w, 1),
where β is the FitzGerald factor dt/ds. The length (26.5) of a velocity
is always unity.
If we transfer dxµ/ds continually along itself by parallel displacement we obtain a geodesic. For by (29.4) the condition for parallel

whose direction undergoes no absolute change.

It will be seen from (34.5) that Bµνσρ, besides being antisymmetrical
in ν and σ, is also antisymmetrical in µ and ρ. Also it is symmetrical
for the double interchange µ and ν, ρ and σ. It has the further cyclic
property
Bµνσρ + Bµσρν + Bµρνσ = 0, (34.6)
as is easily verified from (34.5).
The general tensor of the fourth rank has 256 different components.
Here the double antisymmetry reduces the number (apart from differences of sign) to 6 × 6. 30 of these are paired because µ, ρ can be
interchanged with ν, σ; but the remaining 6 components, in which µ, ρ
is the same pair of numbers as ν, σ, are without partners. This leaves
21 different components, between which (34.6) gives only one further
relation. We conclude that the Riemann-Christoffel tensor has 20 independent components∗
.
∗Writing the suffixes in the order µρσν the following scheme gives 21 different
ch. ii the riemann-christoffel tensor 120
The Riemann-Christoffel tensor is derived solely from the gµν and
therefore belongs to the class of fundamental tensors. Usually we can
form from any tensor a series of tensors of continually increasing rank
by covariant differentiation. But this process is frustrated in the case of
the fundamental tensors because gµνσ vanishes identically. We have got
round the gap and reached a fundamental tensor of the fourth rank. The
series can now be continued indefinitely by covariant differentiation.

Accordingly when B
µσν vanishes, the differential dAµ determined

We can then carry the vector Aµ. by parallel displacement to any
point obtaining a unique result independent of the route of transfer. If
a vector is displaced in this way all over the field, we obtain a uniform
vector-field.
This construction of a uniform vector-field is only possible when
the Riemann-Christoffel tensor vanishes throughout. In other cases the
equations have no complete integral, and can only be integrated along
a particular route. E.g., we can prescribe a uniform direction at all
points of a plane, but their is nothing analogous to a uniform direction
over the surface of a sphere.

Summary.
Tensors are quantities obeying certain transformation laws. Their
importance lies in the fact that if a tensor equation is found to hold
for one system of coordinates, it continues to hold when any transformation of coordinates is made. New tensors are recognised either by
investigating their transformation laws directly or by the property that
the sum, difference, product or quotient of tensors is a tensor. This is
a generalisation of the method of dimensions in physics.
The principal operations of the tensor calculus are addition, multiplication (outer and inner), summation (§ 22), contraction (§ 24), substitution (§ 25), raising and lowering suffixes (§ 26), covariant differentiation (§§ 29, 30). There is no operation of division; but an inconvenient
factor gµν or g
µν can be removed by multiplying through by g
µσ or gµσ
so as to form the substitution-operator. The operation of summation
is practically outside our control and always presents itself as a fait
accompli. The most characteristic process of manipulation in this calculus is the free alteration of dummy suffixes (those appearing twice
in a term); it is probably this process which presents most difficulty to
the beginner.
Of special interest are the fundamental tensors or world-tensors, of
which we have discovered two, viz. gµν and Bµνσρ. The latter has been
expressed in terms of the former and its first and second derivatives.
It is through these that the gap between pure geometry and physics
is bridged; in particular gµν relates the observed quantity ds to the
mathematical coordinate specification dxµ.
Since in our work we generally deal with tensors, the reader may be
led to overlook the rarity of this property. The juggling tricks which
we seem to perform in our manipulations are only possible because the
material used is of quite exceptional character.
ch. ii miscellaneous formulae 126
The further development of the tensor calculus will be resumed in
§ 48; but a stage has now been reached at which we may begin to apply
it to the theory of gravitation.
CHAPTER III
THE LAW OF GRAVITATION
36. The condition for flat space-time. Natural coordinates.
A region of the world is called flat or homaloidal if it is possible to
construct in it a Galilean frame of reference.
It was shown in § 4 that when the gµν are constants, ds2
can be
reduced to the sum of four squares, and Galilean coordinates can be
constructed. Thus an equivalent definition of flat space-time is that it
is such that coordinates can be found for which the gµν are constants.
When the gµν are constants the 3-index symbols all vanish; but
since the 3-index symbols do not form a tensor, they will not in general
continue to vanish when other coordinates are substituted in the same
flat region. Again, when the gµν are constants, the Riemann-Christoffel
tensor, being composed of products and derivatives of the 3-index symbols, will vanish; and since it is a tensor, it will continue to vanish when
any other coordinate-system is substituted in the same region.
Hence the vanishing of the Riemann-Christoffel tensor is a necessary
condition for flat space-time.
This condition is also sufficient—if the Riemann-Christoffel tensor
vanishes space-time must be flat. This can be proved as follows—
We have found (§ 34) that if
B

µνσ = 0, (36.1)
ch. iii the condition for flat space-time 128
it is possible to construct a uniform vector-field by parallel displacement
of a vector all over the region. Let A
µ
(α)
be four uniform vector-fields
given by α = 1, 2, 3, 4, so that
(A
µ
(α)
)σ = 0
or by (29.4)
∂Aµ
(α)
∂xσ
= −{σ, µ} A

(α)
. (36.2)
Note that α is not a tensor-suffix, but merely distinguishes the four
independent vectors.
We shall use these four uniform vector-fields to define a new
coordinate-system distinguished by accents. Our unit mesh will be
the hyperparallelopiped contained by the four vectors at any point,
and the complete mesh-system will be formed by successive parallel
displacements of this unit mesh until the whole region is filled. One
edge of the unit mesh, given in the old coordinates by
dxµ = A
µ
(1),
has to become in the new coordinates
dx0
α = (1, 0, 0, 0).
Similarly the second edge, dxµ = A
µ
(2), must become dx0
α = (0, 1, 0, 0);
etc. This requires the law of transformation
dxµ = A
µ
(α)
dx0

. (36.3)
Of course, the construction of the accented coordinate-system depends
on the possibility of constructing uniform vector-fields, and this depends on (36.1) being satisfied.

Hence the g

αβ are constant throughout the region. We have thus constructed a coordinate-system fulfilling the condition that the g’s are
constant, and it follows that the space-time is flat.
It will be seen that a uniform mesh-system, i.e. one in which the
unit meshes are connected with one another by parallel displacement, is
necessarily a Cartesian system (rectangular or oblique). Uniformity in
ch. iii the condition for flat space-time 130
this sense is impossible in space-time for which the Riemann-Christoffel
tensor does not vanish, e.g. there can be no uniform mesh-system on a
sphere.
When space-time is not flat we can introduce coordinates which will
be approximately Galilean in a small region round a selected point, the
gµν being not constant but stationary there; this amounts to identifying the curved space-time with the osculating flat space-time for a
small distance round the point. Expressing the procedure analytically,
we choose coordinates such that the 40 derivatives ∂gµν/dxσ vanish
at the selected point. It is fairly obvious from general considerations
that this will always be possible; but the following is a formal proof.
Having transferred the origin to the selected point, make the following
transformation of coordinates

Hence in the new coordinates the 3-index symbols vanish at the
origin; and it follows by (27.4) and (27.5) that the first derivatives of
the g

µν vanish. This is the preliminary transformation presupposed in
§ 4.
We pass on to a somewhat more difficult transformation which is
important as contributing an insight into the significance of B
µνσ.
It is not possible to make the second derivatives of the gµν vanish at
the selected point (as well as the first derivatives) unless the RiemannChristoffel tensor vanishes there; but a great number of other special
conditions can be imposed on the 100 second derivatives by choosing
the coordinates suitably. Make an additional transformation of the

since the remaining terms of (34.4) vanish in the coordinates here used.
We cannot alter any of the components of the Riemann-Christoffel tensor; but, subject to this limitation, the alterations of the derivatives of
the 3-index symbols are arbitrary.
The most symmetrical way of imposing further conditions is to make
a transformation such that
∂

{µν, } +
∂

{µσ, } +

{νσ, } = 0. (36.7)
There are 80 different equations of this type, each of which fixes one
of the 80 arbitrary coefficients a

µνσ. In addition there are 20 independent equations of type (36.6) corresponding to the 20 independent
components of the Riemann-Christoffel tensor. Thus we have just sufficient equations to determine uniquely the 100 second derivatives of
the gµν. Coordinates such that ∂gµν/∂xσ is zero and ∂

satisfies (36.7) may be called canonical coordinates.

By solving the 100 equations we obtain all the ∂

The transformation in fact alters the curvature and hypercurvature of
the axes passing through the origin, but does not alter the angles of
intersection.
Consider any tensor which contains only the gµν and their first and
second derivatives. In canonical coordinates the first derivatives vanish
and the second derivatives are linear functions of the B
µνσ; hence the
whole tensor is a function of the gµν and the B
µνσ. But neither the
tensor itself nor the gµν and B
µνσ have been altered in the reduction
to canonical coordinates, hence the same functional relation holds true
in the original unrestricted coordinates. We have thus the important
result—
The only fundamental tensors which do not contain derivatives
of gµν beyond the second order are functions of gµν and B
µνσ.
ch. iii the condition for flat space-time 134
This shows that our treatment of the tensors describing the character of space-time has been exhaustive as far as the second order. If for
suitably chosen coordinates two surfaces have the same gµν and B
µνσ
at some point, they will be applicable to one another as far as cubes
of the coordinates; the two tensors suffice to specify the whole metric
round the point to this extent.
Having made the first derivatives vanish, we can by the linear transformation explained in § 4 give the gµν Galilean values at the selected
point. The coordinates so obtained are called natural coordinates at
the point and quantities referred to these coordinates are said to be
expressed in natural measure. Natural coordinates are thus equivalent
to Galilean coordinates when only the gµν and their first derivatives are
considered; the difference appears when we study phenomena involving
the second derivatives.
By making a Lorentz transformation (which leaves the coordinates
still a natural system) we can reduce to rest the material located at
the point, or an observer supposed to be stationed with his measuring
appliances at the point. The natural measure is then further particularised as the proper-measure of the material, or observer. It may be
noticed that the material will be at rest both as regards velocity and
acceleration (unless it is acted on by electromagnetic forces) because
there is no field of acceleration relative to natural coordinates.
To sum up this discussion of special systems of coordinates.—When
the Riemann-Christoffel tensor vanishes, we can adopt Galilean coordinates throughout the region. When it does not vanish we can adopt
coordinates which agree with Galilean coordinates at a selected point
in the values of the gµν and their first derivatives but not in the second
derivatives; these are called natural coordinates at the point. Either
Galilean or natural coordinates can be subjected to Lorentz transformations, so that we can select a system with respect to which a partic-
ch. iii the condition for flat space-time 135
ular observer is at rest; this system will be the proper-coordinates for
that observer. Although we cannot in general make natural coordinates
agree with Galilean coordinates in the second derivatives of the gµν, we
can impose 80 partially arbitrary conditions on the 100 second derivatives; and when these conditions are selected as in (36.7) the resulting
coordinates have been called canonical.
There is another way of specialising coordinates which may be mentioned here for completeness. It is always possible to choose coordinates
such that the determinant g = −1 everywhere (as in Galilean coordinates). This is explained in § 49.
We may also consider another class of specialised coordinates—
those which are permissible in special problems. There are certain
(non-Euclidean) coordinates found to be most convenient in dealing
with the gravitational field of the sun, Einstein’s or de Sitter’s curved
world, and so on. It must be remembered, however, that these refer
to idealised problems, and coordinate-systems with simple properties
can only be approximately realised in nature. If possible a static system of coordinates is selected, the condition for this being that all
the gµν are independent of one of the coordinates x4 (which must be
of timelike character∗
). In that case the interval corresponding to any
displacement dxµ is independent of the “time” x4. Such a system can,
of course, only be found if the relative configuration of the attracting
masses is maintained unaltered. If in addition it is possible to make g14,
g24, g34 = 0 the time will be reversible, and in particular the forward
velocity of light along any track will be equal to the backward velocity; this renders the application of the name “time” to x4 more just,
since one of the alternative conventions of § 11 is satisfied. We shall if
possible employ systems which are static and reversible in dealing with
∗dx4 will be timelike if g44 is always positive.
ch. iii einstein’s law of gravitation 136
large regions of the world; problems in which this simplification is not
permissible must generally be left aside as insoluble–e.g. the problem
of two attracting bodies. For small regions of the world the greatest
simplification is obtained by using natural coordinates.
37. Einstein’s law of gravitation.
The contracted Riemann-Christoffel tensor is formed by setting
 = σ in B
µνσ. It is denoted by Gµν. Hence by (34.4)
Gµν = {µσ, α}{αν, σ} − {µν, α}{ασ, σ} +
∂
∂xν
{µσ, σ} − ∂
∂xσ
{µν, σ}.
(37.1)
The symbols containing a duplicated suffix are simplified by (35.4), viz.
{µσ, σ} =

Hence, with some alterations of dummy suffixes,
Gµν = −

because

owing to the antisymmetry of Bµνσρ in µ and ρ.
The law
Gµν = 0, (37.3)
ch. iii einstein’s law of gravitation 137
in empty space, is chosen by Einstein for his law of gravitation.
We see from (37.2) that Gµν is a symmetrical tensor; consequently
the law provides 10 partial differential equations to determine the gµν.
It will be found later (§ 52) that there are 4 identical relations between
them, so that the number of equations is effectively reduced to 6. The
equations are of the second order and involve the second differential
coefficients of gµν linearly. We proved in § 36 that tensors not containing
derivatives beyond the second must necessarily be compounded from
gµν and B
µνσ; so that, unless we are prepared to go beyond the second
order, the choice of a law of gravitation is very limited, and we can
scarcely avoid relying on the tensor Gµν
∗
.
Without introducing higher derivatives, which would seem out of
place in this problem, we can suggest as an alternative to (37.3) the
law
Gµν = λgµν, (37.4)
where λ is a universal constant. There are theoretical grounds for
believing that this is actually the correct form; but it is certain that
λ must be an extremely small constant, so that in practical applications
we still take (37.3) as sufficiently approximate. The introduction of the
small constant λ leads to the spherical world of Einstein or de Sitter to
which we shall return in Chapter V.
The spur
G = g
µνGµν (37.5)
is called the Gaussian curvature, or simply the curvature, of space-time.
It must be remembered, however, that the deviation from flatness is
described in greater detail by the tensors Gµν and Bµνσρ (sometimes
∗The law Bµνσρ = 0 (giving flat space-time throughout all empty regions) would
obviously be too stringent, since it does not admit of the existence of irreducible
fields of force.
ch. iii the field of an isolated particle 138
called components of curvature) and the vanishing of G is by no means
a sufficient condition for fiat space-time.
Einstein’s law of gravitation expresses the fact that the geometry
of an empty region of the world is not of the most general Riemannian
type, but is limited. General Riemannian geometry corresponds to the
quadratic form (2.1) with the g’s entirely unrestricted functions of the
coordinates; Einstein asserts that the natural geometry of an empty
region is not of so unlimited a kind, and the possible values of the g’s
are restricted to those which satisfy the differential equations (37.3).
It will be remembered that a field of force arises from the discrepancy
between the natural geometry of a coordinate-system and the abstract
Galilean geometry attributed to it; thus any law governing a field of
force must be a law governing the natural geometry. That is why the
law of gravitation must appear as a restriction on the possible natural
geometry of the world. The inverse-square law, which is a plausible law
of weakening of a supposed absolute force, becomes quite unintelligible
(and indeed impossible) when expressed as a restriction on the intrinsic
geometry of space-time; we have to substitute some law obeyed by the
tensors which describe the world-conditions determining the natural
geometry.
38. The gravitational field of an isolated particle.
We have now to determine a particular solution of the equations (37.3). The solution which we shall obtain will ultimately be
shown to correspond to the field of an isolated particle continually at
rest at the origin; and in seeking a solution we shall be guided by our
general idea of the type of solution to be expected for such a particle. This preliminary argument need not be rigorous; the final test is
whether the formulae suggested by it satisfy the equations to be solved.

In flat space-time the interval, referred to spherical polar coordinates and time, is
ds2 = −dr2 − r
2
dθ2 − r
2
sin2
θ dφ2 + dt2
. (38.11)
If we consider what modifications of this can be made without destroying the spherical symmetry in space, the symmetry as regards past
and future time, or the static condition, the most general possible form
appears to be
ds2 = −U(r) dr2 − V (r) (r

where U, V , W are arbitrary functions of r. Let

regard r in (38.12) as more immediately the counterpart of r in (38.11)
than r1 is. If the functions U, V , W differ only slightly from unity, both
r and r1 will have approximately the properties of the radius-vector in
Euclidean geometry; but no length in non-Euclidean space can have
exactly the properties of a Euclidean radius-vector, and it is arbitrary
whether we choose r or r1 as its closest representative. We shall here
choose r1, and accordingly drop the suffix, writing (38.13) in the form

ch. iii the field of an isolated particle 140
Moreover since the gravitational field (or disturbance of flat spacetime) due to a particle diminishes indefinitely as we go to an infinite
distance, we must have λ and ν tend to zero as r tends to infinity.
Formula (38.2) will then reduce to (38.11) at an infinite distance from
the particle.
Our coordinates are
x1 = r, x2 = θ, x3 = φ, x4 = t,

We may leave aside (38.63) which is a mere repetition of (38.62); then

For ordinary speeds this is an extremely small quantity—practically
three times the square of the transverse velocity in terms of the velocity
of light. For example, this ratio for the earth is 0.00000003. In practical
cases the extra term in (39.61) will represent an almost inappreciable
correction to the Newtonian orbit (39.71).
Again in (39.62) and (39.72) the difference between ds and dt is
equally insignificant, even if we were sure of what is meant by dt in the
Newtonian theory. The proper-time for the body is ds, and it might
perhaps be urged that dt in equation (39.72) is intended to refer to this;
but on the other hand s cannot be used as a coordinate since ds is not
a complete differential, and Newton’s “time” is always assumed to be
a coordinate.
Thus it appears that a particle moving in the field here discussed
will behave as though it were under the influence of the Newtonian
force exerted by a particle of gravitational mass m at the origin, the
motion agreeing with the Newtonian theory to the order of accuracy
for which that theory has been confirmed by observation.
By showing that our solution satisfies Gµν = 0, we have proved that
it describes a possible state of the world which might be met with in
nature under suitable conditions. By deducing the orbit of a particle,
we have discovered how that state of the world would be recognised
observationally if it did exist. In this way we conclude that the space-
ch. iii the advance of perihelion 147
time field represented by (38.8) is the one which accompanies (or “is
due to”) a particle of mass m at the origin.
The gravitational mass m is the measure adopted in the Newtonian
theory of the power of the particle in causing a field of acceleration
around it, the units being here chosen so that the velocity of light and
the constant of gravitation are both unity. It should be noticed that we
have as yet given no reason to expect that m in the present chapter has
anything to do with the m introduced in § 12 to measure the inertial
properties of the particle.
For a circular orbit the Newtonian theory gives
m = ω
2
r
3 = v
2
r,
the constant of gravitation being unity. Applying this to the earth,
v = 30 km. per sec. = 10−4
in terms of the velocity of light, and
r = 1.5 · 108 km. Hence the mass m of the sun is approximately
1.5 kilometres. The mass of the earth is 1/300, 000th of this, or about
5 millimetres∗
.
More accurately, the mass of the sun, 1.99 · 1033 grams, becomes in
gravitational units 1.47 kilometres; and other masses are converted in
a like proportion.
∗Objection is sometimes taken to the use of a centimetre as a unit of gravitational (i.e. gravitation-exerting) mass; but the same objection would apply to the
use of a gram, since the gram is properly a measure of a different property of the
particle, viz. its inertia. Our constant of integration m is clearly a length and the
reader may, if he wishes to make this clear, call it the gravitational radius instead
of the gravitational mass. But when it is realised that the gravitational radius
in centimetres, the inertia in grams, and the energy in ergs, are merely measurenumbers in different codes of the same intrinsic quality of the particle, it seems
unduly pedantic to insist on the older discrimination of these units which grew up
on the assumption that they measured qualities which were radically different.

40. The advance of perihelion.
The equation (39.5) for the orbit of a planet can be integrated in
terms of elliptic functions; but we obtain the astronomical results more
directly by a method of successive approximation. We proceed from

so that Kepler’s third law is accurately fulfilled. This result has no
observational significance, being merely a property of the particular
definition of r here adopted. Slightly different coordinate-systems exist
which might with equal right claim to correspond to polar coordinates
in flat space-time; and for these Kepler’s third law would no longer be
exact.
We have to be on our guard against results of this latter kind which
would only be of interest if the radius-vector were a directly measured
quantity instead of a conventional coordinate. The advance of perihelion is a phenomenon of a different category. Clearly the number
of years required for an eccentric orbit to make a complete revolution
returning to its original position is capable of observational test, unaffected by any convention used in defining the exact length of the
radius-vector.

Einstein’s correction to the perihelion of Mercury has removed the
principal discordance in the table, which on the Newtonian theory was
nearly 30 times the probable error. Of the 15 residuals 8 exceed the
probable error, and 3 exceed twice the probable error—as nearly as
∗Newcomb, Astronomical Constants. His results have been slightly corrected by
using a modern value of the constant of precession in the above table; see de Sitter,

greatest residual to be about 3 times the probable error, the residual
of the node of Venus is rather excessive at 4 1

times the probable error,
and may perhaps be a genuine discordance. Einstein’s theory throws
no light on the cause of this discordance.
41. The deflection of light.

and the orbit (39.61) reduces to
d
2u
dφ2
+ u = 3mu2
. (41.1)
The track of a light-pulse is also given by a geodesic with ds = 0
according to (15.8). Accordingly the orbit (41.1) gives the path of a
ray of light.
We integrate by successive approximation. Neglecting 3mu2
the
solution of the approximate equation
d

ch. iii displacement of the fraunhofer lines 154
It has been explained in Space, Time and Gravitation that this
deflection is double that which might have been predicted on the Newtonian theory. In this connection the following paradox has been remarked. Since the curvature of the light-track is doubled, the acceleration of the light at each point is double the Newtonian acceleration;
whereas for a slowly moving object the acceleration is practically the
same as the Newtonian acceleration. To a man in a lift descending
with acceleration m/r2
the tracks of ordinary particles will appear to
be straight lines; but it looks as though it would require an acceleration 2m/r2
to straighten out the light-tracks. Does not this contradict
the principle of equivalence?
The fallacy lies in a confusion between two meanings of the word
“curvature.” The coordinate curvature obtained from the equation of
the track (41.4) is not the geodesic curvature. The latter is the curvature with which the local observer—the man in the lift—is concerned.
Consider the curved light-track traversing the hummock corresponding
to the sun’s field; its curvature can be reckoned by projecting it either
on the base of the hummock or on the tangent plane at any point. The
curvatures of the two projections will generally be different. The projection into Euclidean coordinates (x, y) used in (41.4) is the projection
on the base of the hummock; in applying the principle of equivalence
the projection is on the tangent plane, since we consider a region of the
curved world so small that it cannot be discriminated from its tangent
plane.
42. Displacement of the Fraunhofer lines.
Consider a number of similar atoms vibrating at different points in
the region. Let the atoms be momentarily at rest in our coordinatesystem (r, θ, φ, t). The test of similarity of the atoms is that correspond-
ch. iii displacement of the fraunhofer lines 155
ing intervals should be equal, and accordingly the interval of vibration
of all the atoms will be the same.
Since the atoms are at rest we set dr, dθ, dφ = 0 in (38.8), so that
ds2 = γ dt2
. (42.1)
Accordingly the times of vibration, of the differently placed atoms will
be inversely proportional to √γ.
Our system of coordinates is a static system, that is to say the gµν
do not change with the time. (An arbitrary coordinate-system has not
generally this property; and further when we have to take account of
two or more attracting bodies, it is in most cases impossible to find
a strictly static system of coordinates.) Taking an observer at rest in
the system (r, θ, φ, t) a wave emitted by one of the atoms will reach
him at a certain time δt after it leaves the atom; and owing to the
static condition this time-lag remains constant for subsequent waves.
Consequently the waves are received at the same time-periods as they
are emitted. We are therefore able to compare the time-periods dt
of the different atoms, by comparing the periods of the waves received
from them, and can verify experimentally their dependence on the value
of √γ at the place where they were emitted. Naturally the most hopeful
test is the comparison of the waves received from a solar and a terrestrial
atom whose periods should be in the ratio 1.00000212 : 1. For wavelength 4000 ˚A, this amounts to a relative displacement of 0.0082 ˚A of
the respective spectral lines. The verdict of experiment is not yet such
as to secure universal assent; but it is now distinctly more favourable to
Einstein’s theory than when Space, Time and Gravitation was written.
The quantity dt is merely an auxiliary quantity introduced through
the equation (38.8) which defines it. The fact that it is carried to us
unchanged by light-waves is not of any physical interest, since dt was
defined in such a way that this must happen. The absolute quantity ds,
ch. iii displacement of the fraunhofer lines 156
the interval of the vibration, is not carried to us unchanged, but becomes gradually modified as the waves take their course through the
non-Euclidean space-time. It is in transmission through the solar system that the absolute difference is introduced into the waves, which the
experiment hopes to detect.
The argument refers to similar atoms and the question remains
whether, for example, a hydrogen atom on the sun is truly similar to
a hydrogen atom on the earth. Strictly speaking it cannot be exactly
similar because it is in a different kind of space-time, in which it would
be impossible to make a finite structure exactly similar to one existing
in the space-time near the earth. But if the interval of vibration of the
hydrogen atom is modified by the kind of space-time in which it lies,
the difference must be dependent on some invariant of the space-time.
The simplest invariant which differs at the sun and the earth is the
square of the length of the Riemann-Christoffel tensor, viz.
B

.
The value of this can be calculated from (38.8) by the method used in
that section for calculating the Gµν. The result is

By consideration of dimensions it seems clear that the proportionate
change of ds would be of the order
σ

,
where σ is the radius of the atom; there does not seem to be any other
length concerned. For a comparison of solar and terrestrial atoms this
ch. iii isotropic coordinates 157
would be about 10−100. In any case it seems impossible to construct
from the invariants of space-time a term which would compensate the
predicted shift of the spectral lines, which is proportional to m/r.

At a distance r1 from the origin the velocity of light is accordingly

light is not the same for the radial and transverse directions.
Again in the isotropic system the coordinate length (p

of a small rod which is rigid (ds = constant) does not alter when the
orientation of the rod is altered. This system of coordinates is naturally arrived at when we partition space by rigid scales or by lighttriangulations in a small region, e.g. in terrestrial measurements. Since
the ultimate measurements involved in any observation are carried out
in a terrestrial laboratory we ought, strictly speaking, always to employ the isotropic system which conforms to assumptions made in those
measurements∗
. But on the earth the quantity m/r is negligibly small,
so that the two systems coalesce with one another and with Euclidean
coordinates. Non-Euclidean geometry is only required in the theoretical
part of the investigation—the laws of planetary motion and propagation of light through regions where m/r is not negligible; as soon as the
∗But the terrestrial laboratory is falling freely towards the sun, and is therefore
accelerated relatively to the coordinates (x, y, z, t).
ch. iii isotropic coordinates 159
light-waves have been safely steered into the terrestrial observatory,
the need for non-Euclidean geometry is at an end, and the difference
between the isotropic and non-isotropic systems practically disappears.
In either system the forward velocity of light along any line is equal
to the backward velocity. Consequently the coordinate t conforms to
the convention (§ 11) that simultaneity may be determined by means of
light-signals. If we have a clock at A and send a light-signal at time tA
which reaches B and is immediately reflected so as to return to A at
time t

A, the time of arrival at B will be 1

(tA +t

A) just as in the special
relativity theory. But the alternative convention, that simultaneity can
be determined by slow transport of chronometers, breaks down when
there is a gravitational field. This is evident from § 42, since the timerate of a clock will depend on its position in the field. In any case slow
transport of a clock is unrealisable because of the acceleration which
all objects must submit to.

ch. iii problem of two bodies—motion of the moon 160
Owing to an identical relation between G11, G22 and G44, the vanishing of this tensor gives only two equations to determine the three
unknowns λ, µ, ν. There exists therefore an infinite series of particular solutions, differing according to the third equation between λ, µ,
ν which is at our disposal. The two solutions hitherto considered are
obtained by taking µ = 0, and λ = µ, respectively. The same series of solutions is obtained in a simpler way by substituting arbitrary
functions of r instead of r in (38.8).
The possibility of substituting any function of r for r without destroying the spherical symmetry is obvious from the fact that a coordinate is merely an identification-number; but analytically this possibility
is bound up with the existence of an identical relation between G11, G22
and G44, which makes the equations too few to determine a unique solution.
This introduces us to a theorem of great consequence in our later
work. If Einstein’s ten equations Gµν = 0 were all independent, the
ten gµν would be uniquely determined by them (the boundary conditions being specified). The expression for ds2 would be unique and no
transformation of coordinates would be possible. Since we know that
we can transform coordinates as we please, there must exist identical
relations between the ten Gµν; and these will be found in § 52.
44. Problem of two bodies—Motion of the moon.
The field described by the gµν may be (artificially) divided into a
field of pure inertia represented by the Galilean values, and a field of
force represented by the deviations of the gµν from the Galilean values.
It is not possible to superpose the fields of force due to two attracting
particles; because the sum of the two solutions will not satisfy Gµν = 0,
these equations being non-linear in the gµν.
ch. iii problem of two bodies—motion of the moon 161
No solution of Einstein’s equations has yet been found for a field
with two singularities or particles. The simplest case to be examined
would be that of two equal particles revolving in circular orbits round
their centre of mass. Apparently there should exist a statical solution
with two equal singularities; but the conditions at infinity would differ
from those adopted for a single particle since the axes corresponding
to the static solution constitute what is called a rotating system. The
solution has not been found, and it is even possible that no such statical solution exists. I do not think it has yet been proved that two
bodies can revolve without radiation of energy by gravitational waves.
In discussions of this radiation problem there is a tendency to beg the
question; it is not sufficient to constrain the particles to revolve uniformly, then calculate the resulting gravitational waves, and verify that
the radiation of gravitational energy across an infinite sphere is zero.
That shows that a statical solution is not obviously inconsistent with
itself, but does not demonstrate its possibility.
The problem of two bodies on Einstein’s theory remains an outstanding challenge to mathematicians—like the problem of three bodies
on Newton’s theory.
For practical purposes methods of approximation will suffice. We
shall consider the problem of the field due to the combined attractions
of the earth and sun, and apply it to find the modifications of the
moon’s orbit required by the new law of gravitation. The problem has
been treated in considerable detail by de Sitter∗
. We shall not here
attempt a complete survey of the problem; but we shall seek out the
largest effects to be looked for in refined observations. There are three
sources of fresh perturbations:
(1) The sun’s attraction is not accurately given by Newton’s law,
∗Monthly Notices, vol. 77, p. 155.
ch. iii problem of two bodies—motion of the moon 162
and the solar perturbations of the moon’s orbit will require corrections.
(2) Cross-terms between the sun’s and the earth’s fields of force will
arise, since these are not additive.
(3) The earth’s field is altered and would inter alia give rise to a
motion of the lunar perigee analogous to the motion of Mercury’s perihelion. It is easily calculated that this is far too small to be detected.
If ΩS, ΩE are the Newtonian potentials of the sun and earth, the
leading terms of (1), (2), (3) will be relatively of order of magnitude
Ω
2
S
, ΩSΩE, ΩE.
For the moon ΩS = 750 ΩE. We may therefore confine attention to
terms of type (1). If these prove to be too small to be detected, the
others will presumably be not worth pursuing.
We were able to work out the planetary orbits from Einstein’s law independently of the Newtonian theory; but in the problem of the moon’s
motion we must concentrate attention on the difference between Einstein’s and Newton’s formulae if we are to avoid repeating the whole
labour of the classical lunar theory. In order to make this comparison
we transform (39.31) and (39.32) so that t is used as the independent
variable.

It must be pointed out that these perturbing forces are Einstein’s
corrections to the law of central force m/r2
, where r is the coordinate used in our previous work. Whether these forces represent the
actual differences between Einstein’s and Newton’s laws depends on
what Newton’s r is supposed to signify. De Sitter, making a slightly
different choice of r, obtains different expressions for R, Φ∗
. One cannot
say that one set of perturbing forces rather than the other represents
the difference from the older theory, because the older theory was not
sufficiently explicit. The classical lunar theory has been worked out on
the basis of the law m/r2
; the ambiguous quantity r occurs in the results, and according as we have assigned to it one meaning or another,
so we shall have to apply different corrections to those results. But the
final comparison with observation does not depend on the choice of the
intermediary quantity r.
Take fixed rectangular axes referred to the ecliptic with the sun as
origin, and let
(a, 0, 0) be the coordinates of the earth at the instant considered,
(x, y, z) the coordinates of the moon relative to the earth.
Taking the earth’s orbit to be circular and treating the mass of
the moon as infinitesimal, the earth’s velocity will be (0, v, 0), where
v
2 = m/a.
To find the difference of the forces R, Φ, Z on the moon and on the
earth, we differentiate (44.23) and set
δr = x, δ(u, v, w) = (dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt),
and, after the differentiation,
r = a, (u, v, w) = (0, v, 0).

We shall omit the term −2m2x/a4

gives no important observable effects. It produces only an apparent distortion of the orbit attributable to our use of non-isotropic coordinates

We keep the axes (ξ, η) permanently fixed; the angle θ which gives

the long run take all values with equal frequency independently of the
moon’s position in its orbit. We can only hope to observe the secular

It is easily seen that ω is a very small quantity, so that ω

is negligible. The equations (44.7) are then recognised as the Newtonian
equations referred to axes rotating with angular velocity −ω. Thus if
we take the Newtonian orbit and give it an angular velocity +ω, the
result will be the solution of (44.7). The leading correction to the lunar
theory obtained from Einstein’s equations is a precessional effect, indicating that the classical results refer to a frame of reference advancing
with angular velocity ω compared with the general inertial frame of the
solar system.
From this cause the moon’s node and perigee will advance with
velocity ω. If Ω is the earth’s angular velocity

Hence the advance of perigee and node in a century is
3π · 10−6
radians = 100
.94.
We may notice the very simple theoretical relation that Einstein’s
corrections cause an advance of the moon’s perigee which is one half
the advance of the earth’s perihelion.
Neither the lunar theory nor the observations are as yet carried
quite far enough to take account of this small effect; but it is only a
ch. iii problem of two bodies—motion of the moon 167
little below the limit of detection. The result agrees with de Sitter’s
value except in the second decimal place which is only approximate.
There are well-known irregular fluctuations in the moon’s longitude
which attain rather large values; but it is generally considered that
these are not of a type which can be explained by any amendment
of gravitational theory and their origin must be looked for in other
directions. At any rate Einstein’s theory throws no light on them.
The advance of 100
.94 per century has not exclusive reference to the
moon; in fact the elements of the moon’s orbit do not appear in (44.6).
It represents a property of the space surrounding the earth—a precession of the inertial frame in this region relative to the general inertial
frame of the sidereal system. If the earth’s rotation could be accurately measured by Foucault’s pendulum or by gyrostatic experiments,
the result would differ from the rotation relative to the fixed stars by
this amount. This result seems to have been first pointed out by J. A.
Schouten. One of the difficulties most often urged against the relativity
theory is that the earth’s rotation relative to the mean of the fixed stars
appears to be an absolute quantity determinable by dynamical experiments on the earth∗
; it is therefore of interest to find that these two
rotations are not exactly the same, and the earth’s rotation relative to
the stellar system (supposed to agree with the general inertial frame of
the universe) cannot be determined except by astronomical observations.
The argument of the relativist is that the observed effect on Foucault’s pendulum can be accounted for indifferently by a field of force or
by rotation. The anti-relativist replies that the field of force is clearly
a mathematical fiction, and the only possible physical cause must be
absolute rotation. It is pointed out to him that nothing essential is
gained by choosing the so-called non-rotating axes, because in any case
∗Space, Time and Gravitation, p. 152.
ch. iii solution for a particle in a curved world 168
the main part of the field of force remains, viz. terrestrial gravitation.
He retorts that with his non-rotating axes he has succeeded in making
the field of force vanish at infinity, so that the residuum is accounted for
as a local disturbance by the earth; whereas, if axes fixed in the earth
are admitted, the corresponding field of force becomes larger and larger
as we recede from the earth, so that the relativist demands enormous
forces in distant parts for which no physical cause can be assigned. Suppose, however, that the earth’s rotation were much slower than it is now,
and that Foucault’s experiment had indicated a rotation of only −1
00
.94
per century. Our two disputants on the cloud-bound planet would no
doubt carry on a long argument as to whether this was essentially an
absolute rotation of the earth in space, the irony of the situation being that the earth all the while was non-rotating in the anti-relativist’s
sense, and the proposed transformation to allow for the Foucault rotation would actually have the effect of introducing the enormous field of
force in distant parts of space which was so much objected to. When
the origin of the 100
.94 has been traced as in the foregoing investigation,
the anti-relativist who has been arguing that the observed effect is definitely caused by rotation, must change his position and maintain that
it is definitely due to a gravitational perturbation exerted by the sun
on Foucault’s pendulum; the relativist holds to his view that the two
causes are not distinguishable.
45. Solution for a particle in a curved world.
In later work Einstein has adopted the more general equations (37.4)
Gµν = αgµν. (45.1)

At a place where γ vanishes there is an impassable barrier, since
any change dr corresponds to an infinite distance i ds surveyed by
measuring-rods. The two roots of the quadratic (45.3) are approximately
r = 2m and r =
p
3/α.
The first root would represent the boundary of the particle—if a genuine
particle could exist—and give it the appearance of impenetrability. The
second barrier is at a very great distance and may be described as the
horizon of the world.
It is clear that the latter barrier (or illusion of a barrier) cannot be
at a less distance than the most remote celestial objects observed, say
1025 cm. This makes α less than 10−50 (cm.)−2
. Inserting this value
in (45.5) we find that the additional motion of perihelion will be well
below the limit of observational detection for all planets in the solar
system∗

46. Transition to continuous matter.
In the Newtonian theory of attractions the potential Ω in empty
space satisfies the equation
∇2Ω = 0,
∗This could scarcely have been asserted a few years ago, when it was not known
that the stars extended much beyond 1000 parsecs distance. A horizon distant 700
parsecs corresponds to a centennial motion of about 100 in the earth’s perihelion, and
greater motion for the more distant planets in direct proportion to their periods.
ch. iii transition to continuous matter 171
of which the elementary solution is Ω = m/r; then by a well-known
procedure we are able to deduce that in continuous matter
∇2Ω = −4πρ. (46.1)
We can apply the same principle to Einstein’s potentials gµν, which
in empty space satisfy the equations Gµν = 0. The elementary solution has been found, and it remains to deduce the modification of the
equations in continuous matter. The logical aspects of the transition
from discrete particles to continuous density need not be discussed here,
since they are the same for both theories.
When the square of m/r is neglected, the isotropic solution (43.3)
for a particle continually at rest becomes∗

The particle need not be at the origin provided that r is the distance
from the particle to the point considered.
Summing the fields of force of a number of particles, we obtain
ds2 = −(1 + 2Ω)(dx2 + dy2 + dz2
) + (1 − 2Ω)dt2
, (46.2)
where
Ω = X m
r

The inaccuracy in neglecting the interference of the fields of the particles is of the same order as that due to the neglect of m2/r2
, if the
number of particles is not unduly large.
∗This approximation though sufficient for the present purpose is not good
enough for a discussion of the perihelion of Mercury. The term in m2/r2
in the
coefficient of dt2 would have to be retained.

to the same approximation.
Consider the tensor defined by

We readily find
Tµν = 0, except T44 = ρ,
and raising the suffixes
T
µν = 0, except T

since the g
µν are Galilean to the order of approximation required.
Consider the expression
ρ0
dxµ

where dxµ/ds refers to the motion of the matter, and ρ0 is the properdensity (an invariant). The matter is at rest in the coordinates hitherto

ds = 0,

so that all components of the expression vanish, except the component

µν = ρ0
dxµ

dxν
ds , (46.8)
ch. iii transition to continuous matter 174
since the density ρ in (46.7) is clearly the proper-density.
Now (46.8) is a tensor equation∗
, and since it has been verified for
one set of coordinates it is true for all coordinate-systems. Equations
(46.6) and (46.8) together give the extension of Einstein’s law of gravitation for a region containing continuous matter of proper-density ρ0
and velocity dxµ/ds.
The question remains whether the neglect of m2
causes any inaccuracy in these equations. In passing to continuous matter we diminish m
for each particle indefinitely, but increase the number of particles in a
given volume. To avoid increasing the number of particles we may
diminish the volume, so that the formulae (46.5) will be true for the
limiting case of a point inside a very small portion of continuous matter. Will the addition of surrounding matter in large quantities make
any difference? This can contribute nothing directly to the tensor Gµν,
since so far as this surrounding matter is concerned the point is in empty
space; but Einstein’s equations are non-linear and we must consider the
possible cross-terms.
Draw a small sphere surrounding the point P which is being considered. Let gµν = δµν+hµν+h
0
µν, where δµν represents the Galilean values,
and hµν and h
0
µν represent the fields of force contributed independently
by the matter internal to and external to the sphere. By § 36 we can
choose coordinates such that at P h0
µν and its first derivatives vanish;
and by the symmetry of the sphere the first derivatives of hµν vanish,
whilst hµν itself tends to zero for an infinitely small sphere. Hence the
cross-terms which are of the form

∗When an equation is stated to be a tensor equation, the reader is expected to
verify that the covariant dimensions of both sides are the same.
ch. iii transition to continuous matter 175
will all vanish at P. Accordingly with these limitations there are no
cross-terms, and the sum of the two solutions hµν and h
0
µν is also a
solution of the accurate equations. Hence the values (46.5) remain
true. It will be seen that the limitation is that the coordinates must
be “natural coordinates” at the point P. We have already paid heed
to this in taking ρ to be the proper-density.
We have assumed that the matter at P is not accelerated with respect to these natural axes at P. (The original particles had to be
continually at rest, otherwise the solution (46.15) does not apply.) If
it were accelerated there would have to be a stress causing the acceleration. We shall find later that a stress contributes additional terms
to the Gµν. The formulae (46.5) apply only strictly when there is no
stress and the continuous medium is specified by one variable only, viz.
the density.
The reader may feel that there is still some doubt as to the rigour
of this justification of the neglect of m2∗
. Lest he attach too great
importance to the matter, we may state at once that the subsequent
developments will not be based on this investigation. In the next chapter we shall arrive at the same formulae by a different line of argument,
and proceed in the reverse direction from the laws of continuous matter
to the particular case of an isolated particle.
∗To illustrate the difficulty, what exactly does ρ0 mean, assuming that it is not
defined by (46.6) and (46.7)? If the particles do not interfere with each other’s
fields, ρ0 is Pm per unit volume; but if we take account of the interference, m is
undefined—it is the constant of integration of an equation which does not apply.
Mathematically, we cannot say what m would have been if the other particles had
been removed; the question is nonsensical. Physically we could no doubt say what
would have been the masses of the atoms if widely separated from one another, and
compare them with the gravitational power of the atoms under actual conditions;
but that involves laws of atomic structure which are quite outside the scope of the
argument.
ch. iii experiment and deductive theory 176
The equation (46.2) is a useful expression for the gravitational field
due to a static distribution of mass. It is only a first approximation
correct to the order m/r, but no second approximation exists except
in the case of a solitary particle. This is because when more than one
particle is present accelerations necessarily occur, so that there cannot
be an exact solution of Einstein’s equations corresponding to a number
of particles continually at rest. It follows that any constraint which
could keep them at rest must necessarily be of such a nature as to
contribute a gravitational field on its own account.
It will be useful to give the values of Gµν −

47. Experiment and deductive theory.
So far as I am aware, the following is a complete list of the postulates
which have been introduced into our mathematical theory up to the
present stage:
1. The fundamental hypothesis of § 1.
2. The interval depends on a quadratic function of four coordinatedifferences (§
ch. iii experiment and deductive theory 177
3. The path of a freely moving particle is in all circumstances a
geodesic (§ 15).
4. The track of a light-wave is a geodesic with ds = 0 (§ 15).
5. The law of gravitation for empty space is Gµν = 0, or more
probably Gµν = λgµν, where λ is a very small constant (§ 37).
No. 4 includes the identification of the velocity of light with the
fundamental velocity, which was originally introduced as a separate
postulate in § 6.
In the mathematical theory we have two objects before us—to examine how we may test the truth of these postulates, and to discover
how the laws which they express originate in the structure of the world.
We cannot neglect either of these aims; and perhaps an ideal logical
discussion would be divided into two parts, the one showing the gradual
ascent from experimental evidence to the finally adopted specification
of the structure of the world, the other starting with this specification
and deducing all observational phenomena. The latter part is specially
attractive to the mathematician for the proof may be made rigorous;
whereas at each stage in the ascent some new inference or generalisation is introduced which, however plausible, can scarcely be considered
incontrovertible. We can show that a certain structure will explain all
the phenomena; we cannot show that nothing else will.
We may put to the experiments three questions in crescendo. Do
they verify? Do they suggest? Do they (within certain limitations)
compel the laws we adopt? It is when the last question is put that the
difficulty arises for there are always limitations which will embarrass
the mathematician who wishes to keep strictly to rigorous inference.
What, for example, does experiment enable us to assert with regard
to the gravitational field of a particle (the other four postulates being
granted)? Firstly, we are probably justified in assuming that the interval can be expressed in the form (38.2), and experiment shows that
ch. iii experiment and deductive theory 178
λ and ν tend to zero at great distances. Provided that e
λ and e
ν are
simple functions it will be possible to expand the coefficients in the
form

Now reference to §§ 39, 40, 41 enables us to decide the following points:
(1) The Newtonian law of gravitation shows that b1 = −2m.
(2) The observed deflection of light then shows that a1 = −2m.
(3) The motion of perihelion of Mercury then shows that b2 = 0.
The last two coefficients are not determined experimentally with any
high accuracy; and we have no experimental knowledge of the higher
coefficients. If the higher coefficients are zero we can proceed to deduce
that this field satisfies Gµν = 0.
If small concessions are made, the case for the law Gµν = 0 can
be strengthened. Thus if only one linear constant m is involved in the
specification of the field, b2 must contain m3
, and the corresponding
term is of order (m/r)
3
, an extremely small quantity. Whatever the
higher coefficients may be, Gµν will then vanish to a very high order of
approximation.
Turning to the other object of our inquiry, we have yet to explain
how these five laws originate in the structure of the world. In the next
chapter we shall be concerned mainly with Nos. 3 and 5, which are
not independent of one another. They will be replaced by a broader
principle which contains them both and is of a more axiomatic character. No. 4 will be traced to its origin in the electromagnetic theory
of Chapter VI. Finally a synthesis of these together with Nos. 1 and 2
ch. iii experiment and deductive theory 179
will be attempted in the closing chapter.
The following forward references will enable the reader to trace exactly what becomes of these postulates in the subsequent advance towards more primitive conceptions:
Nos. 1 and 2 are not further considered until § 97.
No. 3 is obtained directly from the law of gravitation in § 56.
No. 4 is obtained from the electromagnetic equations in § 74. These
are traced to their origin in § 96.
No. 5 is obtained from the principle of identification in § 54, and
more completely from the principle of measurement in § 66. The possibility of alternative laws is discussed in § 62.
In the last century the ideal explanation of the phenomena of nature
consisted in the construction of a mechanical model, which would act
in the way observed. Whatever may be the practical helpfulness of
a model, it is no longer recognised as contributing in any way to an
ultimate explanation. A little later, the standpoint was reached that
on carrying the analysis as far as possible we must ultimately come to a
set of differential equations of which further explanation is impossible.
We can then trace the modus operandi, but as regards ultimate causes
we have to confess that “things happen so, because the world was made
in that way.” But in the kinetic theory of gases and in thermodynamics
we have laws which can be explained much more satisfactorily. The
principal laws of gases hold, not because a gas is made “that way,” but
because it is made “just anyhow.” This is perhaps not to be taken
quite literally; but if we could see that there was the same inevitability
in Maxwell’s laws and in the law of gravitation that there is in the laws
of gases, we should have reached an explanation far more complete
than an ultimate arbitrary differential equation. This suggests striving
for an ideal—to show, not that the laws of nature come from a special
construction of the ultimate basis of everything, but that the same laws
ch. iii experiment and deductive theory 180
of nature would prevail for the widest possible variety of structure of
that basis. The complete ideal is probably unattainable and certainly
unattained; nevertheless we shall be influenced by it in our discussion,
and it appears that considerable progress in this direction is possible.
CHAPTER IV
RELATIVITY MECHANICS
48. The antisymmetrical tensor of the fourth rank.
A tensor Aµν is said to be antisymmetrical if
Aνµ = −Aµν.
It follows that A11 = −A11, so that A11, A22, A33, A44 must all be zero.
Consider a tensor of the fourth rank E
αβγδ which is antisymmetrical
for all pairs of suffixes. Any component with two suffixes alike must
be zero, since by the rule of antisymmetry E
αβ11 = −E
αβ11. In the
surviving components, α, β, γ, δ, being all different, must stand for the
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 in arbitrary order. We can pass from any of these
components to E
1234 by a series of interchanges of the suffixes in pairs,
and each interchange merely reverses the sign. Writing E for E
1234, all
the 256 components have one or other of the values
+E, 0, −E.
We shall write
E
αβγδ = E · αβγδ, (48.1)
ch. iv the antisymmetrical tensor of the fourth rank 182
where
αβγδ = 0, when the suffixes are not all different,
= +1, when they can be brought to the order 1, 2, 3, 4 by an
even number of interchanges,
= −1, when an odd number of interchanges is needed.
It will appear later that E is not an invariant; consequently αβγδ is
not a tensor.
The coefficient αβγδ is particularly useful for dealing with determinants. If |kµν| denotes the determinant formed with the elements kµν
(which need not form a tensor), we have
4! × |kµν| = αβγδζηθ kαkβζkγηkδθ, (48.2)
because the terms of the determinant are obtained by selecting four
elements, one from each row (α, β, γ, δ, all different) and also from
each column (, ζ, η, θ, all different) and affixing the + or − sign to the
product according as the order of the columns is brought into the order
of the rows by an even or odd number of interchanges. The factor 4!
appears because every possible permutation of the same four elements
is included separately in the summation on the right.
It is possible by corresponding formulae to define and manipulate
determinants in three dimensions (with 64 elements arranged in a cube)
or in four dimensions.
Note that
αβγδζηθ = 4!. (48.31)

There are about 280 billion terms on the right, and we proceed to
rearrange those which do not vanish.
For non-vanishing terms the letters ν, ξ, o, $ denote the same
suffixes as α, β, γ, δ, but (usually) in a different order. Permute the
four factors in which they occur so that they come into the same order;
the suffixes of the denominators will then come into a new order, say,
i, k, l, m. Thus

dSµν =




δ1xµ δ1xν
δ2xµ δ2xν




.
Similarly we define the volume-element (four-dimensional) corresponding to the hyperparallelopiped contained by four displacements, δ1xµ,
ch. iv element of volume. tensor-density 186
δ2xµ, δ3xµ, δ4xµ, as the tensor
dV µνστ =

δ4xµ δ4xν δ4xσ δ4xτ








. (49.1)
It will be seen that the determinant is an antisymmetrical tensor of the
fourth rank, and its 256 components accordingly have one or other of
the three values
+dV, 0, −dV,
where dV = ±dV 1234. It follows from (48.65) that (dV )
2
g is an invariant, so that
√
−g · dV is an invariant. (49.2)
Since the sign of dV 1234 is associated with some particular cycle of
enumeration of the edges of the parallelopiped, which is not usually
of any importance, the single positive quantity dV is usually taken to
represent the volume-element fully. Summing a number of infinitesimal
volume-elements, we have
Z Z Z Z √
−g · dV is an invariant, (49.3)
the integral being taken over any region defined independently of the
coordinates.
When the quadruple integral is regarded as the limit of a sum, the
infinitesimal parallelopipeds may be taken of any shape and orientation;
but for analytical integration we choose them to be coincident with
meshes of the coordinate-system that is being used, viz.
δ1xµ = (dx1, 0, 0, 0); δ2xµ = (0, dx2, 0, 0); etc.
ch. iv element of volume. tensor-density 187
Then (49.1) reduces to a single diagonal
dV = dx1 dx2 dx3 dx4.
We write dτ for the volume-element when chosen in this way, so that
dτ = dx1 dx2 dx3 dx4.
It is not usually necessary to discriminate between dτ and the more
general expression dV ; and we shall usually regard √
−g·dτ as an invariant. Strictly speaking we mean that √
−g · dτ behaves as an invariant
in volume-integration; whereas √
−g · dV is intrinsically invariant.
For Galilean coordinates x, y, z, t, we have √
−g = 1, so that
√
−g dτ = dx dy dz dt. (49.41)
Further if we take an observer at rest in this Galilean system, dx dy dz is
his element of proper-volume (three-dimensional) dW, and dt is his
proper-time ds. Hence
√
−g dτ = dW ds. (49.42)
By (49.41) we see that √
−g dτ is the volume in natural measure
of the four-dimensional element. This natural or invariant volume is a
physical conception—the result of physical measures made with unconstrained scales; it may be contrasted with the geometrical volume dV
or dτ , which expresses the number of unit meshes contained in the
region.
Let T be a scalar, i.e. an invariant function of position; then, since
T
√
−g dV is an invariant,
Z
T
√
−g dτ is an invariant
ch. iv element of volume. tensor-density 188
for any absolutely defined four-dimensional region. Each unit mesh
(whose edges dx1, dx2, dx3, dx4 are unity) contributes the amount
T
√
−g to this invariant. Accordingly we call T
√
−g the scalar-density∗
or invariant-density.
A nearly similar result is obtained for tensors. The integral
Z
T
µν√
−g dτ
over an absolutely defined region is not a tensor; because, although it is
the sum of a number of tensors, these tensors are not located at the same
point and cannot be combined (§ 33). But in the limit as the region
is made infinitely small its transformation law approaches more and
more nearly that of a single tensor. Thus T
µν√
−g is a tensor-density,
representing the amount per unit mesh of a tensor in the infinitesimal
region round the point.
It is usual to represent the tensor-density corresponding to any tensor by the corresponding German letter; thus
T
µν ≡ T
µν√
−g; T ≡ T
√
−g. (49.5)
By (48.1)
E
αβγδ ≡ E
αβγδ√
−g = E
√
−g · αβγδ,
and since E
√
−g is an invariant it follows that αβγδ is a tensor-density.
Physical quantities are of two main kinds, e.g.
Field of acceleration = intensity of some condition at a point,
Momentum = quantity of something in a volume.
∗
I have usually avoided the superfluous word “scalar,” which is less expressive
than its synonym “invariant.” But it is convenient here in order to avoid confusion
between the density of an invariant and a density which is invariant. The latter, ρ0,
has hitherto been called the invariant density (without the hyphen).
ch. iv element of volume. tensor-density 189
The latter kind are naturally expressed as “so much per unit mesh.”
Hence intensity is naturally described by a tensor, and quantity by a
tensor-density. We shall find √
−g continually appearing in our formulae; that is an indication that the physical quantities concerned
are strictly tensor-densities rather than tensors. In the general theory tensor-densities are at least as important as tensors.
We can only speak of the amount of momentum in a large volume
when a definite system of coordinates has been fixed. The total momentum is the sum of the momenta in different elements of volume; and
for each element there will be different coefficients of transformation,
when a change of coordinates is made. The only case in which we can
state the amount of something in a large region without fixing a special
system of coordinates is when we are dealing with an invariant; e.g. the
amount of “Action” in a large region is independent of the coordinates.
In short, tensor-analysis (except in the degenerate case of invariants)
deals with things located at a point and not spread over a large region;
that is why we usually have to use densities instead of quantities.
Alternatively we can express a physical quantity of the second kind
as “so much per unit natural volume (√
−g dτ )”; it is then represented
by a tensor. From the physical point of view it is perhaps as rational
to express it in this way, as to express it by a tensor-density “so much
per unit mesh (dτ ).” But analytically this is a somewhat hybrid procedure, because we seem to be employing simultaneously two systems
of coordinates, the one openly for measuring the physical quantity, the
other (a natural system) implicitly for measuring the volume containing it. It cannot be considered wrong in a physical sense to represent
quantities of the second kind by tensors; but the analysis exposes our
sub-conscious reference to √
−g dτ , by the repeated appearance of √
−g
in the formulae.
In any kind of space-time it is possible to choose coordinates such
ch. iv the problem of the rotating disc 190
that √
−g = 1 everywhere; for if three of the systems of partitions
have been drawn arbitrarily, the fourth can be drawn so as to intercept
meshes all of equal natural volume. In such coordinates tensors and
tensor-densities become equivalent, and the algebra may be simplified;
but although this simplification does not involve any loss of generality,
it is liable to obscure the deeper significance of the theory, and it is not
usually desirable to adopt it.
50. The problem of the rotating disc.
We may consider at this point a problem of some historic interest—
A disc made of homogeneous incompressible material is caused to
rotate with angular velocity ω; to find the alteration in length of the
radius.
The old paradox associated with this problem—that the circumference moving longitudinally might be expected to contract, whilst the
radius moving transversely is unaltered—no longer troubles us∗
. But
the general theory of relativity gives a quantitative answer to the problem, which was first obtained by Lorentz by a method different from
that given here†
.
We must first have a clear understanding of what is meant by the
word incompressible. Let us isolate an element of the rotating disc,
and refer it to axes with respect to which it has no velocity or acceleration (proper-measure); then except for the fact that it is under stress
due to the cohesive forces of surrounding matter, it is relatively in the
same state as an element of the non-rotating disc referred to fixed axes.
Now the meaning of incompressible is that no stress-system can make
any difference in the closeness of packing of the molecules; hence the
∗Space, Time and Gravitation, p. 75.
†Nature, vol. 106, p. 795.
ch. iv the problem of the rotating disc 191
particle-density a (referred to proper-measure) is the same as for an
element of the non-rotating disc. But the particle-density σ

referred
to axes fixed in space may be different.
We might write down at once by (14.1)
σ
0 = σ(1 − ω

)
− 1
2 ,
since ωr is the velocity of the element. This would in fact give the
right result. But in § 14 acceleration was not taken into account and
we ought to proceed more rigorously. We use the accented coordinates
of § 15 for our rotating system, and easily calculate from (15.4) that
p

and since x

We see that the contraction is one quarter of that predicted by a
crude application of the FitzGerald formula to the circumference.

The divergence of G

In three dimensions the vanishing of the divergence is the condition
of continuity of flux, e.g. in hydrodynamics ∂u/∂x+∂v/∂y+∂w/∂z = 0.
Adding a time-coordinate, this becomes the condition of conservation
or permanence, as will be shown in detail later. It will be realised how
important for a theory of the material world is the discovery of a worldtensor which is inherently permanent.
I think it should be possible to prove (52) by geometrical reasoning in continuation of the ideas of § 33. But I have not been able to
construct a geometrical proof and must content myself with a clumsy
analytical verification.

Since (52) is a tensor relation it is sufficient to show that it holds for
a special coordinate-system; only we must be careful that our special
choice of coordinate-system does not limit the kind of space-time and
so spoil the generality of the proof. It has been shown in § 36 that
in any kind of space-time, coordinates can be chosen so that all the
first derivatives ∂gµν/∂xσ vanish at a particular point; we shall therefore lighten the algebra by taking coordinates such that at the point
considered
∂gµν

since the double interchange σ for τ , ρ for ν, causes two terms to become
equal to the other two.
Comparing (52.51) and (52.52) we see that the required result is
established for coordinates chosen so as to have the property (52.3) at
the point considered; and since it is a tensor equation it must hold true
for all systems of coordinates.
53. The material energy-tensor.
Let ρ0 be the proper-density of matter, and let dxµ/ds refer to the
motion of the matter; we write, as in (46.8),
T
µν = ρ0
dxµ
ds
dxν
ds . (53.1)
Then T
µν (with the associated mixed and covariant tensors) is called
the energy-tensor of the matter.
ch. iv the material energy-tensor 198
For matter moving with any velocity relative to Galilean coordinates, the coordinate-density ρ is given by
ρ = ρ0

dt
ds2
, (53.2)
for, as explained in (14.2), the FitzGerald factor β = dt/ds appears
twice, once for the increase of mass with velocity and once for the
contraction of volume.
Hence in Galilean coordinates
T
µν = ρ
dxµ

so that if u, v, w are the components of velocity

ρuw, ρvw, ρw2

(53.4)
In matter atomically constituted, a volume which is regarded as
small for macroscopic treatment contains particles with widely divergent motions. Thus the terms in (53.4) should be summed for varying
motions of the particles. For macroscopic treatment we express the
summation in the following way.—
Let (u, v, w) refer to the motion of the centre of mass of the element,
and (u1, v1, w1) be the internal motion of the particles relative∗
to the
centre of mass. Then in a term of our tensor such as Pρ(u+u1)(v+v1),
the cross-products will vanish, leaving Pρuv +
Pρu1v1. Now Pρu1v1

In the sense of elementary mechanics, i.e. the simple difference of the

ch. iv the material energy-tensor 199
represents the rate of transfer of u-momentum by particles crossing a
plane perpendicular to the y-axis, and is therefore equal to the internal
stress usually denoted by pxy. We have therefore to add to (53.4)
the tensor formed by the internal stresses, bordered by zeroes. The
summation can now be omitted, ρ referring to the whole density,
and u, v, w to the average or mass-motion of macroscopic elements.
Accordingly
T
µν = pxx + ρu2

by (53.71). Du/Dt is the acceleration of the element of the fluid.
This is the well-known equation of hydrodynamics when no bodyforce is acting. (By adopting Galilean coordinates any field of force
acting on the mass of the fluid has been removed.)
Equations (53.71) and (53.72) express directly the conservation of
mass and momentum, so that for Galilean coordinates these principles
are contained in
∂T µν/∂xν = 0.
In fact ∂T µν/∂xν represents the rate of creation of momentum and
mass in unit volume. In classical hydrodynamics momentum may be
created in the volume (i.e. may appear in the volume without having
crossed the boundary) by the action of a body-force ρX, ρY , ρZ; and
these terms are added on the right-hand side of (53.72). The creation of
mass is considered impossible. Accordingly the more general equations
of classical hydrodynamics are
∂T µν
∂xν
= (ρX, ρY, ρZ, 0). (53.81)
In the special relativity theory mass is equivalent to energy, and the
body-forces by doing work on the particles will also create mass, so
that
∂T µν
∂xν
= (ρX, ρY, ρZ, ρS), (53.82)
where ρS is the work done by the forces ρX, ρY , ρZ. These older
formulae are likely to be only approximate; and the exact formulae
must be deduced by extending the general relativity theory to the case
when fields of force are present, viz. to non-Galilean coordinates.

(T

which results from lowering the suffix µ. In other words the divergence

ch. iv new derivation of einstein’s law of gravitation 202
Taking the view that energy, stress, and momentum belong to the
world (space-time) and not to some extraneous substance in the world,
we must identify the energy-tensor with some fundamental tensor, i.e.
a tensor belonging to the fundamental series derived from gµν.
The fact that the divergence of T
ν
µ vanishes points to an identification with (Gν

Accordingly we set
G

the factor 8π being introduced for later convenience in coordinating the

To pass from (54.1) to (54.21) involves an appeal to the hypothetical Principle of Equivalence; but by taking (54.3) as our fundamental
equation of gravitation (54.21) becomes an identity requiring no hypothetical assumption.
We thus arrive at the law of gravitation for continuous matter (46.6)
but with a different justification. Appeal is now made to a Principle
of Identification. Our deductive theory starts with the interval (introduced by the fundamental axiom of § 1), from which the tensor gµν is
immediately obtained. By pure mathematics we derive other tensors
Gµν, Bµνσρ, and if necessary more complicated tensors. These constitute our world-building material; and the aim of the deductive theory
is to construct from this a world which functions in the same way as
the known physical world. If we succeed, mass, momentum, stress, etc.
must be the vulgar names for certain analytical quantities in the deductive theory; and it is this stage of naming the analytical tensors which
is reached in (54.3). If the theory provides a tensor Gν
µ −

g
ν
µG which
behaves in exactly the same way as the tensor summarising the mass,
momentum and stress of matter is observed to behave, it is difficult to
ch. iv new derivation of einstein’s law of gravitation 203
see how anything more could be required of it∗
.
By means of (53.91) and (54.3) the physical quantities ρ, u, v, w,
pxx, . . . pzz are identified in terms of the fundamental tensors of spacetime. There are 10 of these physical quantities and 10 different components of Gν
µ −
1
2
g
ν
µG, so that the identification is just sufficient. It will
be noticed that this identification gives a dynamical, not a kinematical
definition of the velocity of matter u, v, w; it is appropriate, for example, to the case of a rotating homogeneous and continuous fly-wheel, in
which there is no velocity of matter in the kinematical sense, although
a dynamical velocity is indicated by its gyrostatic properties†
. The connection with the ordinary kinematical velocity, which determines the
direction of the world-line of a particle in four dimensions, is followed
out in § 56.
Contracting (54.3) by setting ν = µ, and remembering that g
µ
µ = 4,
we have
G = 8πT, (54.4)
so that an equivalent form of (54.3) is
G

µ = −8π(T

When there is no material energy-tensor this gives
G

µ = 0,
which is equivalent to Einstein’s law Gµν = 0 for empty space.
∗For a complete theory it would be necessary to show that matter as now defined
has a tendency to aggregate into atoms leaving large tracts of the world vacant. The
relativity theory has not yet succeeded in finding any clue to the phenomenon of
atomicity.
†Space, Time and Gravitation, p. 194.
ch. iv new derivation of einstein’s law of gravitation 204
According to the new point of view Einstein’s law of gravitation does
not impose any limitation on the basal structure of the world. Gµν may
vanish or it may not. If it vanishes we say that space is empty; if it
does not vanish we say that momentum or energy is present; and our
practical test whether space is occupied or not—whether momentum
and energy exist there—is the test whether Gµν exists or not∗
.
Moreover it is not an accident that it should be this particular tensor
which is capable of being recognised by us. It is because its divergence
vanishes—because it satisfies the law of conservation—that it fulfils
the primary condition for being recognised as substantial. If we are to
surround ourselves with a perceptual world at all, we must recognise as
substance that which has some element of permanence. We may not be
able to explain how the mind recognises as substantial the world-tensor
Gν

simpler. There are no doubt minds which have not this predisposition
to regard as substantial the things which are permanent; but we shut
them up in lunatic asylums.

that space is occupied by something. But it may be noticed that the crucial test
is mechanical. A real image has the optical properties but not the mechanical
properties of a solid body.

where λ is a constant. Since the divergence of g
ν
µ
or of g
µν vanishes,
the divergence of this more general form will also vanish, and the laws
of conservation of mass and momentum are still satisfied identically.
Contracting (54.71), we have
G − 4λ = 8πT = 8πρ0. (54.72)
For empty space G = 4λ, and T

µ = 0; and thus the equation reduces

or
Gµν = λgµν,
as in (37.4).
When account is taken of the stresses in continuous matter, or of
the molecular motions in discontinuous matter, the proper-density of
the matter requires rather careful definition. There are at least three
possible definitions which can be justified; and we shall denote the
corresponding quantities by ρ0, ρ00, ρ000.
(1) We define
ρ0 = T.
By reference to (54.6) it will be seen that this represents the sum of
the densities of the particles with different motions, each particle being
referred to axes with respect to which it is itself at rest.
ch. iv new derivation of einstein’s law of gravitation 206
(2) We can sum the densities for the different particles referring
them all to axes which are at rest in the matter as a whole. The result
is denoted by ρ00. Accordingly
ρ00 = T44 referred to axes at rest in the matter as a whole.
(3) If a perfect fluid is referred to axes with respect to which it
is at rest, the stresses pxx, pyy, pzz are each equal to the hydrostatic
pressure p. The energy-tensor (53.5) accordingly becomes
T
µν = p, 0, 0, 0,
0, p, 0, 0,
0, 0, p, 0,
0, 0, 0, ρ00.
Writing ρ00 = ρ000−p, the pressure-terms give a tensor −g
µνp. Accordingly we have have the tensor equation applicable to any coordinatesystem
T
µν = ρ000
dxµ
ds
dxν
ds − g
µνp. (54.81)
Thus if the energy-tensor is analysed into two terms depending respectively on two invariants specifying the state of the fluid, we must take
these invariants to be p and ρ000.
The three quantities are related by
ρ0 = ρ00 − 3p = ρ000 − 4p. (54.82)
If a fluid is incompressible, i.e. if the closeness of packing of the
particles is independent of p, the condition must be that ρ0 is constant∗
.
∗Many writers seem to have defined incompressibility by the condition ρ00 =
constant. This is surely a most misleading definition.
ch. iv the force 207
Incompressibility is concerned with constancy not of mass-density but
of particle-density, so that no account should be taken of increases of
mass of the particles due to motion relative to the centre of mass of the
matter as a whole.
For a liquid or solid the stress does not arise entirely from molecular motions, but is due mainly to direct repulsive forces between the
molecules held in proximity. These stresses must, of course, be included in the energy-tensor (which would otherwise not be conserved)
just as the gaseous pressure is included. It will be shown later that if
these repulsive forces are Maxwellian electrical forces they contribute
nothing to ρ0, so that ρ0 arises entirely from the molecules individually
(probably from the electrons individually) and is independent of the
circumstances of packing.
Since ρ0 is the most useful of the three quantities in theoretical
investigations we shall in future call it the proper-density (or invariant
density) without qualification.

In most applications the velocity of the matter is extremely small
compared with the velocity of light, so that on the right of this equation

. As a first
approximation we neglect the other components, so that
∂

µ = {µ4, 4}ρ. (55.3)
This will agree with classical mechanics (53.92) if
−X, −Y, −Z = {14, 4}, {24, 4}, {34, 4}. (55.4)
The 3-index symbols can thus be interpreted as components of the
field of force. The three quoted are the leading components which
act proportionately to the mass or energy; the others, neglected in
Newtonian mechanics, are evoked by the momenta and stresses which
form the remaining components of the energy-tensor.
The limitation √
−g = 1 is not essential if we take account of the
confusion of tensor-densities with tensors referred to at the end of § 49.
It will be remembered that the force (X, Y, Z) occurs because we attribute to our mesh-system an abstract Galilean geometry which is not
the natural geometry. Either inadvertently or deliberately we place ourselves in the position of an observer who has mistaken his non-Galilean
mesh-system for rectangular coordinates and time. We therefore mistake the unit mesh for the unit of natural volume, and the density
of the energy-tensor T
ν
µ
reckoned per unit mesh is mistaken for the
energy-tensor itself T
ν
µ
reckoned per unit natural volume. For this reason the conservation of the supposed energy-tensor should be expressed
analytically by ∂T

Since (55.1) is equivalent to

the result (55.4) follows irrespective of the value of √

It might seem preferable to avoid this confusion by immediately identifying
the energy, momentum and stress with the components of T

the roundabout procedure of identifying them with T

T

coordinates are used, there is no tendency to confuse the mesh dr dθ dφ with the
natural volume r
2
sin θ dr dθ dφ; in such a case it is much more convenient to take
T
ν
µ as the measure of the density of energy, momentum and stress. It is when by
our attitude of mind we attribute abstract Galilean geometry to coordinates whose
natural geometry is not accurately Galilean, that the automatic substitution of T

Choosing the constant so that g44 = 1 when Ω = 0
g44 = 1 − 2Ω. (55.8)
Special cases of this result will be found in (15.4) and (38.8), Ω being
the potential of the centrifugal force and of the Newtonian gravitational
force respectively.
Let us now briefly review the principal steps in our new derivation
of the laws of mechanics and gravitation. We concentrate attention on

The question arises how this tensor would be recognised in nature—
what names has the practical observer given to its components? We
suppose tentatively that when Galilean or natural coordinates are used
T

is recognised as the amount of mass or energy per unit volume, T
4

,
T

, T

as the negative momentum per unit volume, and the remaining
components contain the stresses according to the detailed specifications in (53.91). This can only be tested by examining whether the
components of T
ν
µ do actually obey the laws which mass, momentum
and stress are known by observation to obey. For natural coordinates
the empirical laws are expressed by ∂Tν
µ
/∂xν = 0, which is satisfied because our tensor from its definition has been proved to satisfy (T

identically. When the coordinates are not natural, the identity T

gives the more general law

µ =

ch. iv dynamics of a particle 211
We attribute an abstract Galilean geometry to these coordinates,
and should accordingly identify the components of T
ν
µ
as before, just
as though the coordinates were natural; but owing to the resulting
confusion of unit mesh with unit natural volume, the tensor-densities
T
4

, T

4 will now be taken to represent the negative momentum
and energy per unit volume.
In accordance with the definition of force as rate of change of momentum, the quantity on the right will be recognised as the (negative)
body-force acting on unit volume, the three components of the force
being given by µ = 1, 2, 3. When the velocity of the matter is very
small compared with the velocity of light as in most ordinary problems, we need only consider on the right the component T
44 or ρ; and
the force is then due to a field of acceleration of the usual type with
components −
1
2
∂g44/∂x1, −
1
2
∂g44/∂x2, −

∂g44/∂x3. The potential Ω
of the field of acceleration is thus connected with g44 by the relation
g44 = 1 − 2Ω. When this approximation is not sufficient there is no
simple field of acceleration; the acceleration of the matter depends not
only on its position but also on its velocity and even on its state of
stress. Einstein’s law of gravitation for empty space Gµν = 0 follows at
once from the above identification of T
ν

.
56. Dynamics of a particle.
An isolated particle is a narrow tube in four dimensions containing
a non-zero energy-tensor and surrounded by a region where the energytensor is zero. The tube is the world-line or track of the particle in
space-time.
The momentum and mass of the particle are obtained by integrating T
4
µ
over a three-dimensional volume; if the result is written in the
ch. iv dynamics of a particle 212
form
−Mu, −Mv, −Mw, M,
then M is the mass (relative to the coordinate system), and (u, v, w) is
the dynamical velocity of the particle, i.e. the ratio of the momenta to
the mass.
The kinematical velocity of the particle is given by the direction of
the tube in four dimensions, viz. 
dx1
dx4
,
dx2
dx4
,
dx3
dx4

along the tube. For
completely continuous matter there is no division of the energy-tensor
into tubes and the notion of kinematical velocity does not arise.
It does not seem to be possible to deduce without special assumptions that the dynamical velocity of a particle is equal to the kinematical
velocity. The law of conservation merely shows that (Mu, Mv, Mw, M)
is constant along the tube when no field of force is acting; it does not
show that the direction of this vector is the direction of the tube.
I think there is no doubt that in nature the dynamical and kinematical velocities are the same; but the reason for this must be sought
in the symmetrical properties of the ultimate particles of matter. If we
assume as in § 38 that the particle is the nucleus of a symmetrical field,
the result becomes obvious. A symmetrical particle which is kinematically at rest cannot have any momentum since there is no preferential
direction in which the momentum could point; in that case the tube is
along the t-axis, and so also is the vector (0, 0, 0, M). It is not necessary
to assume complete spherical symmetry; three perpendicular planes of
symmetry would suffice. The ultimate particle may for example have
the symmetry of an anchor-ring.
It might perhaps be considered sufficient to point out that a “particle” in practical dynamics always consists of a large number of ultimate
particles or atoms, so that the symmetry may be merely a consequence
ch. iv dynamics of a particle 213
of haphazard averages. But we shall find in § 80, that the same difficulty occurs in understanding how an electrical field affects the direction
of the world-line of a charged particle, and the two problems seem to
be precisely analogous. In the electrical problem the motions of the
ultimate particles (electrons) have been experimented on individually,
and there has been no opportunity of introducing the symmetry by
averaging. I think therefore that the symmetry exists in each particle
independently.
It seems necessary to suppose that it is an essential condition for
the existence of an actual particle that it should be the nucleus of a
symmetrical field, and its world-line must be so directed and curved as
to assure this symmetry. A satisfactory explanation of this property
will be reached in § 66.
With this understanding we may use the equation (53.1), involving
kinematical velocity,

By (22.1) this gives dm2/ds = 0. Accordingly the invariant mass of an
isolated particle remains constant.
The present proof does not add very much to the argument in § 17
that the particle follows a geodesic because that is the only track which
is absolutely defined. Here we postulate symmetrical properties for the
particle (referred to proper-coordinates); this has the effect that there is
no means of fixing a direction in which it could deviate from a geodesic.
For further enlightenment we must wait until Chapter V.
57. Equality of gravitational and inertial mass. Gravitational waves.
The term gravitational mass can be used in two senses; it may
refer to (a) the response of a particle to a gravitational field of force,
or (b) to its power of producing a gravitational field of force. In the
sense (a) its identity with inertial mass is axiomatic in our theory, the
separation of the field of force from the inertial field being dependent on
our arbitrary choice of an abstract geometry. We accordingly use the
term exclusively in the sense (b), and we have shown in §§ 38, 39 that
the constant of integration m represents the gravitational mass. But
in the present discussion the ρ0 which occurs in the tensor Tµν refers
to inertial mass defined by the conservation of energy and momentum.
The connection is made via equation (54.3), where on the left the mass
appears in terms of gµν, i.e. in terms of its power of exerting (or being
accompanied by) a gravitational field; and on the right it appears in
the energy-tensor which comprises ρ0 according to (53.1). But it will be
remembered that the factor 8π in (54.3) was chosen arbitrarily, and this
ch. iv equality of gravitational and inertial mass 217
must now be justified∗
. This coefficient of proportionality corresponds
to the Newtonian constant of gravitation.
The proportionality of gravitational and inertial mass, and the “constant of gravitation” which connects them, are conceptions belonging
to the approximate Newtonian scheme, and therefore presuppose that
the gravitational fields are so weak that the equations can be treated
as linear. For more intense fields the Newtonian terminology becomes
ambiguous, and it is idle to inquire whether the constant of gravitation
really remains constant when the mass is enormously great. Accordingly we here discuss only the limiting case of very weak fields, and
set
gµν = δµν + hµν, (57.1)
where δµν represents Galilean values, and hµν will be a small quantity
of the first order whose square is neglected. The derivatives of the gµν
will be small quantities of the first order.

satisfies the gravitational equations correctly to the first order, because
both the equations into which we have divided (57.2) then become
satisfied. Of course there may be other solutions of (57.2), which do
not satisfy (57.31) and (57.32) separately.

agreeing with (46.15). But m as here introduced is the inertial mass
and not merely a constant of integration. We have shown in §§ 38, 39
that the m in (46.15) is the gravitational mass reckoned with constant
of gravitation unity. Hence we see that inertial mass and gravitational
mass are equal and expressed in the same units, when the constant
of proportionality between the world-tensor and the physical-tensor is
chosen to be 8π as in (54.3).
In empty space (57.7) becomes
hµν = 0,
showing that the deviations of the gravitational potentials are propagated as waves with unit velocity, i.e. the velocity of light (§ 30).
ch. iv equality of gravitational and inertial mass 221
But it must be remembered that this representation of the propagation, though always permissible, is not unique. In replacing (57.2) by
(57.31) and (57.32), we introduce a restriction which amounts to choosing a special coordinate-system. Other solutions of (57.2) are possible,
corresponding to other coordinate-systems. All the coordinate-systems
differ from Galilean coordinates by small quantities of the first order.
The potentials gµν pertain not only to the gravitational influence which
has objective reality, but also to the coordinate-system which we select
arbitrarily. We can “propagate” coordinate-changes with the speed of
thought, and these may be mixed up at will with the more dilatory
propagation discussed above. There does not seem to be any way of
distinguishing a physical and a conventional part in the changes of
the gµν.
The statement that in the relativity theory gravitational waves are
propagated with the speed of light has, I believe, been based entirely
on the foregoing investigation; but it will be seen that it is only true in
a very conventional sense. If coordinates are chosen so as to satisfy a
certain condition which has no very clear geometrical importance, the
speed is that of light; if the coordinates are slightly different the speed is
altogether different from that of light. The result stands or falls by the
choice of coordinates and, so far as can be judged, the coordinates here
used were purposely introduced in order to obtain the simplification
which results from representing the propagation as occurring with the
speed of light. The argument thus follows a vicious circle.
Must we then conclude that the speed of propagation of gravitation
is necessarily a conventional conception without absolute meaning? I
think not. The speed of gravitation is quite definite; only the problem of determining it does not seem to have yet been tackled correctly.
To obtain a speed independent of the coordinate-system chosen, we
must consider the propagation not of a world-tensor but of a world-
ch. iv lagrangian form of the gravitational equations 222
invariant. The simplest world-invariant for this purpose is B
µνσBµνσ

,
since G and GµνGµν vanish in empty space. It is scarcely possible to
treat of the propagation of an isolated pulse of gravitational influence,
because there seems to be no way of starting a sudden pulse without
calling in supernatural agencies which violate the equations of mechanics. We may consider the regular train of waves caused by the earth in
its motion round the sun. At a distant point in the ecliptic B
µνσBµνσ

will vary with an annual periodicity; if it has a maximum or minimum
value at the instant when the earth is seen to transit the sun, the inference is that the wave of disturbance has travelled to us at the same
speed as the light. (It may perhaps be objected that there is no proof
that the disturbance has been propagated from the earth; it might be
a stationary wave permanently located round the sun which is as much
the cause as the effect of the earth’s annual motion. I do not think
the objection is valid, but it requires examination.) There does not
seem to be any grave difficulty in treating this problem; and it deserves
investigation.

The formal expression of the conservation of the material energy

Multiply by dx dy dz and integrate through a given three-dimensional
region. The last term is
∂

µ dx dy dz.
The other three terms yield surface-integrals over the boundary of
the region. Thus the law (59.1) states that the rate of change of
RRR T
4
µ dx dy dz is equal to certain terms which describe something going on at the boundary of the region. In other words, changes of this
integral cannot be created in the interior of the region, but are always
traceable to transmission across the boundary. This is clearly what is
meant by conservation of the integral.
ch. iv pseudo-energy-tensor of the gravitational field 228
This equation (59.1) applies only in the special case when the coordinates are such that there is no field of force. We have generalised
it by substituting the corresponding tensor equation T
ν
µν = 0; but this
is no longer a formal expression of the conservation of anything. It is
of interest to compare the traditional method of generalising (59.1) in
which formal conservation is adhered to.
In classical mechanics the law of conservation is restored by recognising another form of energy—potential energy—which is not included
in T
ν
µ
. This is supposed to be stored up in the gravitational field; and
similarly the momentum and stress components may have their invisible
complements in the gravitational field. We have therefore to add to T
ν
µ
a complementary expression t
ν
µ denoting potential energy, momentum
and stress; and conservation is only asserted for the sum. If
Sν
µ = T
ν
µ + t
ν
µ
, (59.2)
then (59.1) is generalised in the form
∂Sν
µ
∂xν
= 0. (59.3)
Accordingly the difference between the relativity treatment and the
classical treatment is as follows. In both theories it is recognised that
in certain cases T
ν
µ
is conserved, but that in the general case this conservation breaks down. The relativity theory treats the general case
by discovering a more exact formulation of what happens to T
ν
µ when
it is not strictly conserved, viz. T
ν
µν = 0. The classical theory treats
it by introducing a supplementary energy, so that conservation is still
maintained but for a different quantity, viz. ∂Sν
µ
/∂xν = 0. The relativity treatment adheres to the physical quantity and modifies the law;
the classical treatment adheres to the law and modifies the physical
ch. iv pseudo-energy-tensor of the gravitational field 229
quantity. Of course, both methods should be expressible by equivalent
formulae; and we have in our previous work spoken of T
ν
µν = 0 as the
law of conservation of energy and momentum, because, although it is
not formally a law of conservation, it expresses exactly the phenomena
which classical mechanics attributes to conservation.
The relativity treatment has enabled us to discover the exact equations, and we may now apply these to obtain the corresponding exact
expression for the quantity Sν
µ
introduced in the classical treatment.
It is clear that t
ν
µ
and therefore Sν
µ
cannot be tensor-densities, because t
ν
µ vanishes when natural coordinates are used at a point, and
would therefore always vanish if it were a tensor-density. We call t
ν
µ
the
pseudo-tensor-density of potential energy.
The explicit value of t

)
(59.5)
It should be understood that in this section we have been occupied
with the transition between the old and new points of view. The quantity t
ν
µ
represents the potential energy of classical mechanics, but we do
not ourselves recognise it as an energy of any kind. It is not a tensordensity and it can be made to vanish at any point by suitably choosing
the coordinates; we do not associate it with any absolute feature of
world-structure. In fact finite values of t
ν
µ
can be produced in an empty
world containing no gravitating matter merely by choice of coordinates.
The tensor-density T
ν
µ
comprises all the energy which we recognise; and
we call it gravitational or material energy indiscriminately according as
it is expressed in terms of gµν or ρ0, u, v, w.
This difference between the classical and the relativity view of energy recalls the remarks on the definition of physical quantities made
in the Introduction. As soon as the principle of conservation of energy
was grasped, the physicist practically made it his definition of energy, so
that energy was that something which obeyed the law of conservation.
He followed the practice of the pure mathematician, defining energy by
the properties he wished it to have, instead of describing how he had
measured it. This procedure has turned out to be rather unlucky in
ch. iv pseudo-energy-tensor of the gravitational field 231
the light of the new developments. It is true that a quantity Sν
µ
can be
found which obeys the definition, but it is not a tensor and is therefore
not a direct measure of an intrinsic condition of the world. Rather than
saddle ourselves with this quantity, which is not now of primary interest, we go back to the more primitive idea of vis viva—generalised, it is
true, by admitting heat or molecular vis viva but not potential energy.
We find that this is not in all cases formally conserved, but it obeys the
law that its divergence vanishes; and from our new point of view this
is a simpler and more significant property than strict conservation.

where the latter expression includes the potential energy and momentum of the body. Changes of M0u

from regions outside the body by action passing through the boundary;
whereas changes of Mu, etc. can be produced by the mutual attractions
of the particles of the body. It is clear that the kinematical velocity, or

The invariant integral

represents the action of the matter in a four-dimensional region.
By (49.42),
A =
Z Z Z Z ρ0 dW ds
=
Z Z m ds, (60.12)
where m is the invariant mass or energy.
Thus the action of a particle having energy m for a proper-time ds
is equal to m ds, agreeing with the definition of action in ordinary
mechanics as energy multiplied by time. By (54.6) another form is
A =

8π
Z Z Z Z G
√
−g dτ, (60.2)
so that (ignoring the numerical factor) G
√
−g, or G, represents the
action-density of the gravitational field. Note that material action and
ch. iv action 233
gravitational action are alternative aspects of the same thing; they are
not to be added together to give a total action.
But in stating that the gravitational action and the material action
are necessarily the same thing, we have to bear in mind a very peculiar conception which is almost always associated with the term Action.
From its first introduction, action has always been looked upon as something whose sole raison d’ˆetre is to be varied—and, moreover, varied in
such a way as to defy the laws of nature! We have thus to remember
that when a writer begins to talk about action, he is probably going to
consider impossible conditions of the world. (That does not mean that
he is talking nonsense—he brings out the important features of the possible conditions by comparing them with impossible conditions.) Thus
we may not always disregard the difference between material and gravitational action; it is impossible that there should be any difference, but
then we are about to discuss impossibilities.
We have to bear in mind the two aspects of action in this subject.
It is primarily a physical quantity having a definite numerical value,
given indifferently by (60.11) or (60.2), which is of special importance
because it is invariant. But it also denotes a mathematical function
of the variables; the functional form, which is all important, will differ
according to which of the two expressions is used. In particular we
have to consider the partial derivatives, and these will depend on the
variables in terms of which the action is expressed.
The Hamiltonian method of variation of an integral is of great importance in this subject; several examples of it will be given presently.
I think it is unfortunate that this valuable method is nearly always
applied in the form of a principle of stationary action. By considering
the variation of the integral for small variations of the gµν, or other
variables, we obtain a kind of generalised differential coefficient which
I will call the Hamiltonian derivative. It may be possible to construct
ch. iv action 234
integrals for which the Hamiltonian derivatives vanish, so that the integral has the stationary property. But just as in the ordinary differential
calculus we are not solely concerned with problems of maxima and minima, and we take some interest in differential coefficients which do not
vanish; so Hamiltonian derivatives may be worthy of attention even
when they disappoint us by failing to vanish.
Let us consider the variation of the gravitational action in a region,
viz.

We see from (60.42) that the action A is only stationary when the
energy-tensor T
µν vanishes, that is to say in empty space. In fact action
is only stationary when it does not exist—and not always then.
It would thus appear that the Principle of Stationary Action is in
general untrue. Nevertheless some modified statement of the principle
appears to have considerable significance. In the actual world the space
occupied by matter (electrons) is extremely small compared with the
empty regions. Thus the Principle of Stationary Action, although not
universally true, expresses a very general tendency—a tendency with
exceptions∗
. Our theory does not account for this atomicity of matter;
and in the stationary variation of action we seem to have an indication
∗
I do not regard electromagnetic fields as constituting an exception, because
they have not yet been taken into account in our work. But the action of matter
has been fully included, so that the break-down of the principle as applied to matter
is a definite exception.
ch. iv a property of invariants 236
of a way of approaching this difficult problem, although the precise
formulation of the law of atomicity is not yet achieved. It is suspected
that it may involve an “action” which is capable only of discontinuous
variation.
It is not suggested that there is anything incorrect in the principle
of least action as used in classical mechanics. The break-down occurs
when we attempt to generalise it for variations of the state of the system beyond those hitherto contemplated. Indeed it is obvious that
the principle must break down if pressed to extreme generality. We
may discriminate (a) possible states of the world, (b) states which although impossible are contemplated, (c) impossible states which are not
contemplated. Generalisation of the principle consists in transferring
states from class (c) to class (b); there must be some limit to this, for
otherwise we should find ourselves asserting that the equation δA 6= 0
is not merely not a possible equation but also not even an impossible
equation.

usual method of partial integration employed in the calculus of variations, these can all be reduced to terms in δgµν, together with complete
differentials.

where the coefficients, here written P

surface-integrals over the boundary, so that they do not contribute to
the variations. In accordance with our previous notation (60.43), we
have
P
µν =
hK
hgµν
. (61.2)
We take P
µν to be symmetrical in µ and ν, since any antisymmetrical part would be meaningless owing to the inner multiplication by δgµν.
Also since δgµν is an arbitrary tensor P
µν must be a tensor.
Consider the case in which the δgµν arise merely from a transformation of coordinates. Then (61.1) vanishes, not from any stationary property, but because of the invariance of K. The δgµν are not
now arbitrary independent variations, so that it does not follow that
P
µν vanishes.
Comparing gµν and gµν + δgµν by (23.22), since they correspond to
a transformation of coordinates,
gµν = (gαβ + δgαβ)

This is a comparison of the fundamental tensor at xα + δxα in the
new coordinate-system with the value at xα in the old system. There
would be no objection to using this value of δgµν provided that we
took account of the corresponding δ(dτ ). We prefer, however, to keep
dτ fixed in the comparison, and must compare the values at xα in both
systems. It is therefore necessary to subtract the change δxα ·∂gµν/∂xα

We have thus demonstrated the general theorem—
The Hamiltonian derivative of any fundamental invariant is a tensor
whose divergence vanishes.
The theorem of § 52 is a particular case, since T
µν is the Hamiltonian
derivative of G by (60.43).
62. Alternative energy-tensors.
We have hitherto identified the energy-tensor with Gν
µ−

2
g
ν
µG mainly
because the divergence of the latter vanishes identically; but the theorem just proved enables us to derive other fundamental tensors whose
divergence vanishes, so that alternative identifications of the energytensor would seem to be possible. The three simplest fundamental
invariants are
K = G, K0 = GµνG
µν, K00 = B
ρ
µνσB
µνσ
ρ
. (62.1)
Hitherto we have taken hK/hgµν to be the energy-tensor; but if
hK0/hgµν were substituted, the laws of conservation of energy and
momentum would be satisfied, since the divergence vanishes. Similarly
hK00/hgµν could be used.
The condition for empty space is given by the vanishing of the
energy-tensor. Hence for the three possible hypotheses, the law of gravitation in empty space is
hK
hgµν
,
hK0
hgµν
,
hK00
hgµν
= 0 (62.2)
ch. iv alternative energy-tensors 240
respectively.
It is easy to see that the last two tensors contain fourth derivatives
of the gµν; so that if we can lay it down as an essential condition that
the law of gravitation in empty space must be expressed by differential
equations of the second order, the only possible energy-tensor is the one
hitherto accepted. For fourth-order equations the question of the nature
of the boundary conditions necessary to supplement the differential
equations would become very difficult; but this does not seem to be a
conclusive reason for rejecting such equations.
The two alternative tensors are excessively complicated expressions;
but when applied to determine the field of an isolated particle, they become not unmanageable. The field, being symmetrical, must be of the
general form (38.2), so that we have only to determine the disposable
coefficients λ and ν both of which must be functions of r only. K0
can be
calculated in terms of λ and ν without difficulty from equations (38.6);
but the expression for K00 turns out to be rather simpler and I shall
deal with it. By the method of § 38, we find

It is clear that the integral of K

the symmetrical condition, so that we need only consider variations of
λ and ν and their derivatives with respect to r. Thus the gravitational
equations hK00/hgµν = 0 are equivalent to
hK00

On substituting these values, (62.5) is verified exactly.
The alternative law hK0/hgµν = 0 is also satisfied by the same
solution. For
δ(GµνG
µν√
−g) = Gµν δ(G
µν√
−g) + G
µν√
−g δGµν,
hence the variation of K0√
−g vanishes wherever Gµν = 0. Any field of
gravitation agreeing with Einstein’s law will satisfy the alternative law
proposed, but not usually vice versa.
There are doubtless other symmetrical solutions for the alternative
laws of gravitation which are not permitted by Einstein’s law, since
the differential equations are now of the fourth order and involve two
extra boundary conditions either at the particle or at infinity. It may
be asked, Why should these be excluded in nature? We can only answer that it may be for the same reason that negative mass, doublets,
electrons of other than standard mass, or other theoretically possible
singularities in the world, do not occur; the ultimate particle satisfies
conditions which are at present unknown to us.
It would seem therefore that there are three admissible laws of gravitation (62.2). Each can give precisely the same gravitational field of
the sun, and all astronomical phenomena are the same whichever law
is used. Small differences may appear in the cross-terms due to two
or more attracting bodies; but as was shown in our discussion of the
lunar theory these are too small to be detected by astronomical observation. Each law gives precisely the same mechanical phenomena, since
the conservation of energy and momentum is satisfied. When we ask
ch. iv gravitational flux from a particle 243
which of the three is the law of the actual world, I am not sure that
the question has any meaning. The subject is very mystifying, and the
following suggestions are put forward very tentatively.
The energy-tensor has been regarded as giving the definition of matter, since it comprises the properties by which matter is described in
physics. Our three energy-tensors give us three alternative material
worlds; and the question is which of the three are we looking at when
we contemplate the world around us; but if these three material worlds
are each doing the same thing (within the limits of observational accuracy) it seems impossible to decide whether we are observing one or
other or all three.
To put it another way, an observation involves the relation of the T
ν
µ
of our bodies to the T
ν
µ
of external objects, or alternatively of the respective T
0ν
µ
or T
00ν
µ
. If these are the same relation it seems meaningless
to ask which of the three bodies and corresponding worlds the relation
is between. After all it is the relation which is the reality. In accepting
T
ν
µ
as the energy-tensor we are simply choosing the simplest of three
possible modes of representing the observation.
One cannot but suspect that there is some identical relation between
the Hamiltonian derivatives of the three fundamental invariants. If this
relation were discovered it would perhaps clear up a rather mysterious
subject.
63. Gravitational flux from a particle.
Let us consider an empty region of the world, and try to create in it
one or more particles of small mass δm by variations of the gµν within
the region. By (60.12) and (60.2),

and by (60.42) the left-hand side is zero because the space is initially
empty. In the actual world particles for which δm · ds is negative do
not exist; hence it is impossible to create any particles in an empty
region, so long as we adhere to the condition that the gµν and their
first derivatives must not be varied on the boundary. To permit the
creation of particles we must give up this restriction and accordingly

Take the region in the form of a long tube and create a particle of
gravitational mass δm along its axis. The flux (63.3) is an invariant,
since δm · ds is invariant, so we may choose the special coordinates of
§ 38 for which the particle is at rest. Take the tube to be of radius r and
calculate the flux for a length of tube dt = ds. The normal component
of (63.3) is given by α = 1 and accordingly the flux is

We have ignored the flux across the two ends of the tube. It is clear
that these will counterbalance one another.
This verification of the general result (63.1) for the case of a single
particle gives another proof of the identity of gravitational mass with
inertial mass.
We see then that a particle is attended by a certain flux of the
quantity (63.3) across all surrounding surfaces. It is this flux which
makes the presence of a massive particle known to us, and characterises
it; in an observational sense the flux is the particle. So long as the space
is empty the flux is the same across all surrounding surfaces however
distant, the radius r of the tube having disappeared in the result; so
that in a sense the Newtonian law of the inverse square has a direct
analogue in Einstein’s theory.
In general the flux is modified in passing through a region containing other particles or continuous matter, since the first term on the
right of (60.3) no longer vanishes. This may be ascribed analytically to
the non-linearity of the field equations, or physically to the fact that
ch. iv gravitational flux from a particle 246
the outflowing influence can scarcely exert its action on other matter
without being modified in the process. In our verification for the single
particle the flux due to δm was independent of the value of m originally
present; but this is an exceptional case due to symmetrical conditions
which cause the integral of T
µν δgµν to vanish although T
µν is not zero.
Usually the flux due to δm will be modified if other matter is initially
present.
For an isolated particle m ds in any region is stationary for variations of its track, this condition being equivalent to (56.6). Hence for
this kind of variation the action 8π
Pm ds in a region is stationary.
The question arises how this is to be reconciled with our previous result (§ 60) that the principle of stationary action is untrue for regions
containing matter. The reason is this:—when we give arbitrary variations to the gµν, the matter in the tube will in general cease to be
describable as a particle, because it has lost the symmetry of its field∗
.
The action therefore is only stationary for a special kind of variation
of gµν in the neighbourhood of each particle which deforms the track
without destroying the symmetry of the particle; it is not stationary
for unlimited variations of the gµν.
The fact that the variations which cause the failure of the principle of stationary action—those which violate the symmetry of the
particles—are impossible in the actual world is irrelevant. Variations
of the track of the particle are equally impossible, since in the actual
world a particle cannot move in any other way than that in which it
does move. The whole point of the Principle of Stationary Action is to
show the relation of an actual state of the world to slightly varied states
which cannot occur. Thus the break-down of the principle cannot be
∗
It will be remembered that in deriving (56.6) we had to assume the symmetry
of the particle.
ch. iv retrospect 247
excused. But we can see now why it gives correct results in ordinary
mechanics, which takes the tracks of the particles as the sole quantities
to be varied, and disregards the more general variations of the state of
the world for which the principle ceases to be true.
64. Retrospect.
We have developed the mathematical theory of a continuum of four
dimensions in which the points are connected in pairs by an absolute
relation called the interval. In order that this theory may not be merely
an exercise in pure mathematics, but may be applicable to the actual
world, the quantities appearing in the theory must at some point be
tied on to the things of experience. In the earlier chapters this was done
by identifying the mathematical interval with a quantity which is the
result of practical measurement with scales and clocks. In the present
chapter this point of contact of theory and experience has passed into
the background, and attention has been focussed on another opportunity of making the connection. The quantity Gν
µ −
1
2
g
ν
µG appearing in
the theory is, on account of its property of conservation, now identified with matter, or rather with the mechanical abstraction of matter
which comprises the measurable properties of mass, momentum and
stress sufficing for all mechanical phenomena. By making the connection between mathematical theory and the actual world at this point,
we obtain a great lift forward.
Having now two points of contact with the physical world, it should
become possible to construct a complete cycle of reasoning. There is
one chain of pure deduction passing from the mathematical interval to
the mathematical energy-tensor. The other chain binds the physical
manifestations of the energy-tensor and the interval; it passes from
matter as now defined by the energy-tensor to the interval regarded as
ch. iv retrospect 248
the result of measurements made with this matter. The discussion of
this second chain still lies ahead of us.
If actual matter had no other properties save such as are implied in
the functional form of Gν
µ −
1
2
g
ν
µG, it would, I think, be impossible to
make measurements with it. The property which makes it serviceable
for measurement is discontinuity (not necessarily in the strict sense,
but discontinuity from the macroscopic standpoint, i.e. atomicity). So
far our only attempt to employ the new-found matter for measuring
intervals has been in the study of the dynamics of a particle in § 56;
we had there to assume that discrete particles exist and further that
they have necessarily a symmetry of field; on this understanding we
have completed the cycle for one of our most important test-bodies—
the moving particle—the geodesic motion of which is used, especially
in astronomy, for comparing intervals. But the theory of the use of
matter for the purpose of measuring intervals will be taken up in a
more general way at the beginning of the next chapter, and it will be
seen how profoundly the existence of the complete cycle has determined
that outlook on the world which we express in our formulation of the
laws of mechanics.
It is a feature of our attitude towards nature that we pay great
regard to that which is permanent; and for the same reason the creation
of anything in the midst of a region is signalised by us as more worthy
of remark than its entry in the orthodox manner through the boundary.
Thus when we consider how an invariant depends on the variables used
to describe the world, we attach more importance to changes which
result in creation than to changes which merely involve transfer from
elsewhere. It is perhaps for this reason that the Hamiltonian derivative
of an invariant gives a quantity of greater significance for us than, for
example, the ordinary derivative. The Hamiltonian derivative has a
creative quality, and thus stands out in our minds as an active agent
ch. iv retrospect 249
working in the passive field of space-time. Unless this idiosyncrasy of
our practical outlook is understood, the Hamiltonian method with its
casting away of boundary integrals appears somewhat artificial; but it is
actually the natural method of deriving physical quantities prominent
in our survey of the world, because it is guided by those principles
which have determined their prominence. The particular form of the
Hamiltonian method known as Least Action, in which special search
is made for Hamiltonian derivatives which vanish, does not appear at
present to admit of any very general application. In any case it seems
better adapted to give neat mathematical formulae than to give physical
insight; to grasp the equality or identity of two physical quantities is
simpler than to ponder over the behaviour of the quantity which is their
difference—distinguished though it may be by the important property
of being incapable of existing!
According to the views reached in this chapter the law of gravitation Gµν = 0 is not to be regarded as an expression for the natural
texture of the continuum, which can only be forcibly broken at points
where some extraneous agent (matter) is inserted. The differentiation
of occupied and unoccupied space arises from our particular outlook on
the continuum, which, as explained above, is such that the Hamiltonian derivatives of the principal invariant G stand out as active agents
against the passive background. It is therefore the regions in which
these derivatives vanish which are regarded by us as unoccupied; and
the law Gµν = 0 merely expresses the discrimination made by this
process.
Among the minor points discussed, we have considered the speed of
propagation of gravitational influence. It is presumed that the speed
is that of light, but this does not appear to have been established rigorously. Any absolute influence must be measured by an invariant,
particularly the invariant Bρ
µνσBµνσ
ρ
. The propagation of this invariant
ch. iv retrospect 250
does not seem to have been investigated.
The ordinary potential energy of a weight raised to a height is not
counted as energy in our theory and does not appear in our energytensor. It is found superfluous because the property of our energytensor has been formulated as a general law which from the absolute
point of view is simpler than the formal law of conservation. The potential energy and momentum t
ν
µ needed if the formal law of conservation
is preserved is not a tensor, and must be regarded as a mathematical fiction, not as representing any significant condition of the world.
The pseudo-energy-tensor t
ν
µ
can be created and destroyed at will by
changes of coordinates; and even in a world containing no attracting
matter (flat space-time) it does not necessarily vanish. It is therefore
impossible to regard it as of a nature homogeneous with the proper
energy-tensor.
CHAPTER V
CURVATURE OF SPACE AND TIME
65. Curvature of a four-dimensional manifold.
In the general Riemannian geometry admitted in our theory the gµν
may be any 10 functions of the four coordinates xµ.
A four-dimensional continuum obeying Riemannian geometry can
be represented graphically as a surface of four dimensions drawn in a
Euclidean hyperspace of a sufficient number of dimensions. Actually
10 dimensions are required, corresponding to the number of the gµν.
For let (y1, y2, y3, . . . , y10) be rectangular Euclidean coordinates, and
(x1, x2, x3, x4) parameters on the surface; the equations of the surface
will be of the form
y1 = f1(x1, x2, x3, x4), . . . . . . , y10 = f10(x1, x2, x3, x4).
For an interval on the surface, the Euclidean geometry of the y’s

When we use the phrase “curvature” in connection with space-time,
we always think of it as embedded in this way in a Euclidean space of
higher dimensions. It is not suggested that the higher space has any
existence; the purpose of the representation is to picture more vividly
the metrical properties of the world. It must be remembered too that a
great variety of four-dimensional surfaces in 10 dimensions will possess
the same metric, i.e. be applicable to one another by bending without
stretching, and any one of these can be chosen to represent the metric
of space-time. Thus a geometrical property of the chosen representative
surface need not necessarily be a property belonging intrinsically to the
space-time continuum.
A four-dimensional surface free to twist about in six additional dimensions has bewildering possibilities. We consider first the simple case
in which the surface, or at least a small portion of it, can be drawn in
Euclidean space of five dimensions.
Take a point on the surface as origin. Let (x1, x2, x3, x4) be rectangular coordinates in the tangent plane (four-dimensional) at the origin;
and let the fifth rectangular axis along the normal be z. Then by Euclidean geometry
−ds2 = dx2
1 + dx2
2 + dx2
3 + dx2
4 + dz2
, (65.1)
imaginary values of ds corresponding as usual to real distances in space.
ch. v curvature of a four-dimensional manifold 253
The four-dimensional surface will be specified by a single equation between the five coordinates, which we may take to be
z = f(x1, x2, x3, x4).
If the origin is a regular point this can be expanded in powers of the x’s.
The deviation from the tangent plane is of the second order compared
with distances parallel to the plane; consequently z does not contain
linear terms in the x’s. The expansion accordingly starts with a homogeneous quadratic function, and the equation is of the form
2z = aµνxµxν, (65.2)
correct to the second order. For a fixed value of z the quadric (65.2) is
called the indicatrix.
The radius of curvature of any normal section of the surface is found
by the well-known method. If t is the radius of the indicatrix in the
direction of the section (direction cosines l1, l2, l3, l4), the radius of
curvature is
ρ =
t
2
2z
=
1
aµνlµlν
.
In particular, if the axes are rotated so as to coincide with the principal
axes of the indicatrix, (65.2) becomes
2z = k1 dx2
1 + k2 dx2
2 + k3 dx2
3 + k4 dx2

, (65.3)
and the principal radii of curvature of the surface are the reciprocals of
k1, k2, k3, k4.
Differentiating (65.2)
dz = aµνxµ dxν, dz2 = aµνxµ dxν · aστxσ dxτ .

Hence, substituting in (65.1)
−ds2 = dx2

for points in the four-dimensional continuum. Accordingly
−gντ = g

Hence at the origin the gµν are Euclidean; their first derivatives

When the principal axes are taken as in (65.3), these results become
G11 = −k1(k2 + k3 + k4),
G22 = −k2(k1 + k3 + k4); etc.)
(65.55)
and
G = 2(k1k2 + k1k3 + k1k4 + k2k3 + k2k4 + k3k4). (65.6)
The invariant G has thus a comparatively simple interpretation in
terms of the principal radii of curvature. It is a generalisation of the
well-known invariant for two-dimensional surfaces 1/ρ1ρ2, or k1k2. But
this interpretation is only possible in the simple case of five dimensions.
In general five dimensions are not sufficient to represent even the small
portion of the surface near the origin; for if we set Gµν = 0 in (65.55),
we obtain kµ = 0, and hence by (65.51) Bµνσρ = 0. Thus it is not
possible to represent a natural gravitational field (Gµν = 0, Bµνσρ 6= 0)
in five Euclidean dimensions.
In the more general case we continue to call the invariant G the
Gaussian curvature although the interpretation in terms of normal curvatures no longer holds. It is convenient also to introduce a quantity
called the radius of spherical curvature, viz. the radius of a hypersphere
which has the same Gaussian curvature as the surface considered∗
.
∗A hypersphere of four dimensions is by definition a four-dimensional surface
drawn in five dimensions so that (65.6) applies to it. Accordingly if its radius is R,
we have G = 12/R2
. For three dimensions G = 6/R2
; for two dimensions G = 2/R2
.
ch. v curvature of a four-dimensional manifold 256
Considering the geometry of the general case, in 10 dimensions the
normal is a six-dimensional continuum in which we can take rectangular
axes z1, z2, . . . , z6. The surface is then defined by six equations which
near the origin take the form
2zr = arµνxµxν (r = 1, 2, . . . , 6).
The radius of curvature of a normal section in the direction lµ is then

It is, however, of little profit to develop the properties of normal curvature, which depend on the surface chosen to represent the metric of
space-time and are not intrinsic in the metric itself. We therefore follow
a different plan, introducing the radius of spherical curvature which has
invariant properties.
Reverting for the moment to five dimensions, consider the threedimensional space formed by the section of our surface by x1 = 0. Let
G(1) be its Gaussian curvature. Then G(1) is formed from G by dropping
all terms containing the suffix 1—a dimension which no longer enters
into consideration. Accordingly G − G(1) consists of those terms of G
which contain the suffix 1; and by (65.53) and (65.54) we have
1
2
(G − G(1)) = −G11. (65.71)
Introducing the value g11 = −1 at the origin
G11 −
1
2
g11G =
1
2G(1). (65.72)
This result obtained for five dimensions is perfectly general. From
the manner in which (65.4) was obtained, it will be seen that each of the
ch. v interpretation of einstein’s law of gravitation 257
six z’s will make contributions to gντ which are simply additive; we have
merely to sum aµνaστxµxσ for the six values of aµνaστ contributed by
the six terms dz2
r
. All the subsequent steps involve linear equations and
the work will hold for six z’s just as well as for one z. Hence (65.72) is
true in the general case when the representation requires 10 dimensions.
Now consider the invariant quadric
(Gµν −
1
2
gµνG) dxµ dxν = 3. (65.81)
Let ρ1 be the radius of this quadric in the x1 direction, so that dxµ =
(ρ1, 0, 0, 0) is a point on the quadric; the equation gives
(G11 −

2
g11G)ρ

1 = 3,
so that by (65.72)
G(1) =
6
ρ

. (65.82)
But for a hypersphere of radius R of three dimensions (k1 = k2 =
k3 = 1/R; k4 disappears) the Gaussian curvature is 6/R2
. Hence ρ1 is
the radius of spherical curvature of the three-dimensional section of the
world perpendicular to the axis x1.
Now the quadric (65.81) is invariant, so that the axis x1 may be
taken in any arbitrary direction. Accordingly we see that—
The radius of the quadric (Gµν =
1
2
gµνG) dxµ dxν = 3 in any direction is equal to the radius of spherical curvature of the corresponding
three-dimensional section of the world.
We call this quadric the quadric of curvature.
66. Interpretation of Einstein’s law of gravitation.
We take the later form of Einstein’s law (37.4)
Gµν = λgµν, (66.1)
ch. v interpretation of einstein’s law of gravitation 258
in empty space, λ being a universal constant at present unknown but
so small as not to upset the agreement with observation established for
the original form Gµν = 0. We at once obtain G = 4λ, and hence
Gµν −
1
2
gµνG = −λgµν.
Substituting in (65.81) the quadric of curvature becomes
−λgµν dxµ dxν = 3,
or
−ds2 = 3/λ. (66.2)
That is to say, the quadric of curvature is a sphere of radius p
3/λ, and
the radius of curvature in every direction∗ and at every point in empty
space has the constant length p
3/λ.
Conversely if the directed radius of curvature in empty space is
homogeneous and isotropic Einstein’s law will hold.
The statement that the radius of curvature is a constant length
requires more consideration before its full significance is appreciated.
Length is not absolute, and the result can only mean constant relative
to the material standards of length used in all our measurements and
in particular in those measurements which verify Gµν = λgµν. In order
to make a direct comparison the material unit must be conveyed to the
place and pointed in the direction of the length to be measured. It
is true that we often use indirect methods avoiding actual transfer or
orientation; but the justification of these indirect methods is that they
∗For brevity I use the phrase “radius of curvature in a direction” to mean the
radius of spherical curvature of the three-dimensional section of the world at right
angles to that direction. There is no other radius of curvature associated with a
direction likely to be confused with it.
ch. v interpretation of einstein’s law of gravitation 259
give the same result as a direct comparison, and their validity depends
on the truth of the fundamental laws of nature. We are here discussing
the most fundamental of these laws, and to admit the validity of the
indirect methods of comparison at this stage would land us in a vicious
circle. Accordingly the precise statement of our result is that the radius
of curvature at any point and in any direction is in constant proportion
to the length of a specified material unit placed at the same point and
orientated in the same direction.
This becomes more illuminating if we invert the comparison—
The length of a specified material structure bears a constant ratio to
the radius of curvature of the world at the place and in the direction in
which it lies. (66.3)
The law no longer appears to have any reference to the constitution
of an empty continuum. It is a law of material structure showing what
dimensions a specified collection of molecules must take up in order to
adjust itself to equilibrium with surrounding conditions of the world.
The possibility of the existence of an electron in space is a remarkable phenomenon which we do not yet understand. The details of its
structure must be determined by some unknown set of equations, which
apparently admit of only two discrete solutions, the one giving a negative electron and the other a positive electron or proton. If we solve
these equations to find the radius of the electron in any direction, the
result must necessarily take the form
radius of electron in given direction = numerical constant
× some function of the conditions in the space into which
the electron was inserted.
And since the quantity on the left is a directed length, the quantity on
the right must be a directed length. We have just found one directed
ch. v interpretation of einstein’s law of gravitation 260
length characteristic of the empty space in which the electron was introduced, viz. the radius of spherical curvature of a corresponding section
of the world. Presumably by going to third or fourth derivatives of
the gµν other independent directed lengths could be constructed; but
that seems to involve an unlikely complication. There is strong ground
then for anticipating that the solution of the unknown equations will
be
radius of electron in any direction = numerical constant ×
radius of curvature of space-time in that direction.
This leads at once to the law (66.3).
As with the electron, so with the atom and aggregations of atoms
forming the practical units of material structure. Thus we see that
Einstein’s law of gravitation is the almost inevitable outcome of the
use of material measuring-appliances for surveying the world, whatever
may be the actual laws under which material structures are adjusted
in equilibrium with the empty space around them.
Imagine first a world in which the curvature, referred to some chosen
(non-material) standard of measurement, was not isotropic. An electron inserted in this would need to have the same anisotropy in order
that it might obey the same detailed conditions of equilibrium as a symmetrical electron in an isotropic world. The same anisotropy persists
in any material structure formed of these electrons. Finally when we
measure the world, i.e. make comparisons with material structures, the
anisotropy occurs on both sides of the comparison and is eliminated.
Einstein’s law of gravitation expresses the result of this elimination.
The symmetry and homogeneity expressed by Einstein’s law is not a
property of the external world, but a property of the operation of measurement.
ch. v interpretation of einstein’s law of gravitation 261
From this point of view it is inevitable that the constant λ cannot
be zero; so that empty space has a finite radius of curvature relative to
familiar standards. An electron could never decide how large it ought
to be unless there existed some length independent of itself for it to
compare itself with.
It will be noticed that our rectangular coordinates (x1, x2, x3, x4) in
this and the previous section approximate to Euclidean, not Galilean,
coordinates. Consequently x4 is imaginary time, and G(1) is not in any
real direction in the world. There is no radius of curvature in a real
timelike direction. This does not mean that our discussion is limited to
three dimensions; it includes all directions in the four-dimensional world
outside the light-cone, and applies to the space-dimensions of material
structures moving with any speed up to the speed of light. The real
quadric of curvature terminates at the light-cone, and the mathematical
continuation of it lies not inside the cone but in directions of imaginary
time which do not concern us.
By consideration of extension in timelike directions we obtain a
confirmation of these views, which is, I think, not entirely fantastic.
We have said that an electron would not know how large it ought to be
unless there existed independent lengths in space for it to measure itself
against. Similarly it would not know how long it ought to exist unless
there existed a length in time for it to measure itself against. But there
is no radius of curvature in a timelike direction; so the electron does
not know how long it ought to exist. Therefore it just goes on existing
indefinitely.
The alternative laws of gravitation discussed in § 62 would be obtained if the radius of the unit of material structure adjusted itself as
a definite fraction not of the radius of curvature, but of other directed
lengths (of a more complex origin) characteristic of empty space-time.
In § 56 it was necessary to postulate that the gravitational field
ch. v cylindrical and spherical space-time 262
due to an ultimate particle of matter has symmetrical properties. This
has now been justified. We have introduced a new and far-reaching
principle into the relativity theory, viz. that symmetry itself can only
be relative; and the particle, which so far as mechanics is concerned is to
be identified with its gravitational field, is the standard of symmetry.
We reach the same result if we attempt to define symmetry by the
propagation of light, so that the cone ds = 0 is taken as the standard
of symmetry. It is clear that if the locus ds = 0 has complete symmetry
about an axis (taken as the axis of t) ds2 must be expressible by the
formula (38.12).
The double-linkage of field and matter, matter and field, will now
be realised. Matter is derived from the fundamental tensor gµν by the
expression Gν
µ −
1
2
g
ν
µG; but it is matter so derived which is initially
used to measure the fundamental tensor gµν. We have in this section
considered one simple consequence of this cycle—the law of gravitation.
It needs a broader analysis to follow out the full consequences, and this
will be attempted in Chapter VII, Part II.
67. Cylindrical and spherical space-time.
According to the foregoing section λ does not vanish, and there
is a small but finite curvature at every point of space and time. This
suggests the consideration of the shape and size of the world as a whole.
Two forms of the world have been suggested—
(1) Einstein’s cylindrical world. Here the space-dimensions correspond to a sphere, but the time-dimension is uncurved.
(2) De Sitter’s spherical world. Here all dimensions are spherical;
but since it is imaginary time which is homogeneous with the spacecoordinates, sections containing real time become hyperbolas instead
ch. v cylindrical and spherical space-time 263
of circles.
We must describe these two forms analytically. A point on the
surface of a sphere of radius R is described by two angular variables
θ, φ, such that
−ds2 = R
2
(dθ2 + sin2
θ dφ2
).
Extending this to three dimensions, we have three angular variables
such that
−ds2 = R
2

dχ2 + sin2 χ (dθ2 + sin2
θ dφ2
)
	
. (67.11)
Accordingly in Einstein’s form the interval is given by
ds2 = −R
2
dχ2 − R
2
sin2 χ (dθ2 + sin2
θ dφ2
) + dt2
. (67.12)
Of course this form applies only to a survey of the world on the
grand scale. Trifling irregularities due to the aggregation of matter
into stars and stellar systems are treated as local deviations which can
be disregarded.
Proceeding from the origin in any direction, Rχ is the distance
determined by measurement with rigid scales. But the measured area
of a sphere of radius Rχ is not 4πR2χ
2 but 4πR2
sin2 χ. There is not
so much elbow-room in distant parts as Euclid supposed. We reach a
“greatest sphere” at the distance 1
2
πR; proceeding further, successive
spheres contract and decrease to a single point at a distance πR—the
greatest distance which can exist.
The whole volume of space (determined by rigid scales) is finite and
equal to
Z π

4πR2
sin2 χ · R dχ = 2π
2R

. (67.2)
Although the volume of space is finite, there is no boundary; nor is
there any centre of spherical space. Every point stands in the same
relation to the rest of space as every other point.
ch. v cylindrical and spherical space-time 264
To obtain de Sitter’s form, we generalise (67.11) to four dimensions
(i.e. a spherical four-dimensional surface drawn in Euclidean space of
five dimensions). We have four angular variables ω, ζ, θ, φ, and
−ds2 = R
2

dω2 + sin2 ω

dζ2 + sin2
ζ(dθ + sin2
θ dφ2
)
	. (67.31)
In order to obtain a coordinate-system whose physical interpretation is
more easily recognisable, we make the transformation
cos ω = cos χ cosit,
cot ζ = cot χ sin it,
which gives
sin χ = sin ζ sin ω,
tan it = cos ζ tan ω.)
(67.32)
Working out the results of this substitution, we obtain
ds2 = −R
2
dχ2 − R
2
sin2 χ (dθ2 + sin2
θ dφ2
) + R
2
cos2 χ · dt2
. (67.33)
So far as space (χ, θ, φ) is concerned, this agrees with Einstein’s
form (67.12); but the variable t, which will be regarded as the “time”∗
in
this world, has different properties. For a clock at rest (χ, θ, φ = const.)
we have
ds = R cos χ dt, (67.4)
so that the “time” of any cycle is proportional to sec χ. The clock-beats
become longer and longer as we recede from the origin; in particular
the vibrations of an atom become slower. Moreover we can detect by
∗The velocity of light at the origin is now R. In the usual units the time would
be Rt.
ch. v cylindrical and spherical space-time 265
practical measurement this slowing down of atomic vibrations, because
it is preserved in the transmission of the light to us. The coordinates
(67.33) form a statical system, the velocity of light being independent
of t; hence the light-pulses are all delayed in transmission by the same
“time” and reach us at the same intervals of t as they were emitted.
Spectral lines emanating from distant sources at rest should consequently appear displaced towards the red.
At the “horizon” χ =
1
2
π, any finite value of ds corresponds to an
infinite dt. It takes an infinite “time” for anything to happen. All the
processes of nature have come to a standstill so far as the observer at
the origin can have evidence of them.
But we must recall that by the symmetry of the original formula (67.31), any point of space and time could be chosen as origin
with similar results. Thus there can be no actual difference in the
natural phenomena at the horizon and at the origin. The observer on
the horizon does not perceive the stoppage—in fact he has a horizon
of his own at a distance 1
2
πR where things appear to him to have come
to a standstill.
Let us send a ray of light from the origin to the horizon and back
again. (We take the double journey because the time-lapse can then be
recorded by a single clock at the origin; the physical significance of the
time for a single journey is less obvious.) Setting ds = 0, the velocity
of the light is given by
0 = −R
2
dχ2 + R
2
cos2 χ dt2
,
so that
dt = ± sec χ dχ,
whence
t = ± log tan( 1

χ). (67.5)
ch. v elliptical space 266
This must be taken between the limits χ = 0 and 1
2
π; and again with
reversed sign between the limits 1
2
π and 0. The result is infinite, and
the journey can never be completed.
De Sitter accordingly dismisses the paradox of the arrest of time at
the horizon with the remark that it only affects events which happen
before the beginning or after the end of eternity. But we shall discuss
this in greater detail in § 70.
68. Elliptical space.
The equation (67.11) for spherical space, which appears in both
de Sitter’s and Einstein’s form of the interval, can also be construed as
representing a slightly modified kind of space called “elliptical space.”
From the modern standpoint the name is rather unfortunate, and does
not in any way suggest its actual nature. We can approach the problem
of elliptical space in the following way—
Suppose that in spherical space the physical processes going on at
every point are exactly the same as those going on at the antipodal
point, so that one half of the world is an exact replica of the other
half. Let ABA0B0 be four points 90◦ apart on a great circle. Let us
proceed from B0
, via A, to B; on continuing the journey along BA0
it is impossible to tell that we are not repeating the journey B0A already performed. We should be tempted to think that the arc B0A was
in fact the immediate continuation of AB, B and B0 being the same
point and only represented as wide apart through some fault in our
projective representation—just as in a Mercator Chart we see the same
Behring Sea represented at both edges of the map. We may leave to the
metaphysicist the question whether two objects can be exactly alike,
both intrinsically and in relation to all surroundings, and yet differ
in identity; physics has no conception of what is meant by this mys-
ch. v elliptical space 267
terious differentiation of identity; and in the case supposed, physics
would unhesitatingly declare that the observer was re-exploring the
same hemisphere.
Thus the spherical world in the case considered does not consist of
two similar halves, but of a single hemisphere imagined to be repeated
twice over for convenience of projective representation. The differential
geometry is the same as for a sphere, as given by (67.11), but the
connectivity is different; just as a plane and a cylinder have the same
differential geometry but different connectivity. At the limiting circle
of any hemisphere there is a cross-connection of opposite ends of the
diameters which it is impossible to represent graphically; but that is,
of course, no reason against the existence of the cross-connection.
This hemisphere which returns on itself by cross-connections is the
type of elliptical space. In what follows we shall not need to give separate consideration to elliptical space. It is sufficient to bear in mind
that in adopting spherical space we may be representing the physical
world in duplicate; for example, the volume 2π
2R3 already given may
refer to the duplicated world.
The difficulty in conceiving spherical or elliptical space arises mainly
because we think of space as a continuum in which objects are located.
But it was explained in § 1 that location is not the primitive conception, and is of the nature of a computational result based on the more
fundamental notion of extension or distance. In using the word “space”
it is difficult to repress irrelevant ideas; therefore let us abandon the
word and state explicitly that we are considering a network of intervals (or distances, since at present we are not dealing with time). The
relation of interval or distance between two points is of some transcendental character comparable, for example, with a difference of potential
or with a chemical affinity; the reason why this particular relation is
always associated with geometrical ideas must be sought in human psy-
ch. v law of gravitation for curved space-time 268
chology rather than in its intrinsic nature. We apply measure-numbers
to the interval as we should apply them to any other relation of the two
points; and we thus obtain a network with a number attached to every
chord of the net. We could then make a string model of the network,
the length of each string corresponding to the measure-number of the
interval. Clearly the form of this model—the existence or non-existence
of unexpected cross-connections—cannot be predicted a priori; it must
be the subject of observation and experiment. It may turn out to correspond to a lattice drawn by the mathematician in a Euclidean space;
or it may be cross-connected in a way which cannot be represented in
a lattice of that kind. Graphical representation is serviceable as a tool
but is dangerous as an obsession. If we can find a graphical representation which conforms to the actual character of the network, we may
employ it; but we must not imagine that any considerations as to suitability for graphical representation have determined the design of the
network. From experience we know that small portions of the network
do admit of easy representation as a lattice in flat space, just as small
portions of the earth’s surface can be mapped on a flat sheet. It does
not follow that the whole earth is flat, or that the whole network can
be represented in a space without multiple connection.
69. Law of gravitation for curved space-time.
By means of the results (43.5) the Gµν can be calculated for either
Einstein’s or de Sitter’s forms of the world. De Sitter’s equation (67.33)

Hence by (43.5) we find after an easy reduction

θ, G44 = 3 cos2 χ.
These are equivalent to

world if the matter in the world is suitably distributed. To determine

Since λ is still at our disposal, the distribution of this energy-tensor is
indeterminate. But it is noted that within the stellar system the speed
of matter, whether of molecules or of stars, is generally small compared
with the velocity of light. There is perhaps a danger of overstressing this
evidence, since astronomical research seems to show that the greater
the scale of our exploration the more divergent are the velocities; thus
the spiral nebulae, which are perhaps the most remote objects observed,
have speeds of the order 500 km. per sec.—at least ten times greater
than the speeds observed in the stellar system. It seems possible that at
still greater distances the velocities may increase further. However, in
Einstein’s solution we assume that the average velocity of the material
particles is always small compared with the velocity of light; so the
general features of the world correspond to
T11 = T22 = T33 = 0, T44 = ρ, T = ρ0,
where ρ0 is the average density (in natural measure) of the matter in
space.
Hence by (69.3)

R can scarcely be less than 1018 kilometres since the distances of some of
the globular clusters exceed this. Remembering that the gravitational
mass of the sun is 1.5 kilometres, the mass of the matter in the world
must be equivalent to at least a trillion suns, if Einstein’s form of the
world is correct.
It seems natural to regard de Sitter’s and Einstein’s forms as two
limiting cases, the circumstances of the actual world being intermediate
between them. De Sitter’s empty world is obviously intended only as
a limiting case; and the presence of stars and nebulae must modify it,
if only slightly, in the direction of Einstein’s solution. Einstein’s world
containing masses far exceeding anything imagined by astronomers,
might be regarded as the other extreme—a world containing as much
matter as it can hold. This view denies any fundamental cleavage of
the theory in regard to the two forms, regarding it as a mere accident,
depending on the amount of matter which happens to have been created, whether de Sitter’s or Einstein’s form is the nearer approximation
to the truth. But this compromise has been strongly challenged, as we
shall see.

Thus a particle at rest will not remain at rest unless it is at the origin; but will be repelled from the origin with an acceleration increasing
with the distance. A number of particles initially at rest will tend to
scatter, unless their mutual gravitation is sufficient to overcome this
tendency.
ch. v properties of de sitter’s spherical world 273
It can easily be verified that there is no such tendency in Einstein’s
world. A particle placed anywhere will remain at rest. This indeed is
necessary for the self-consistency of Einstein’s solution, for he requires
the world to be filled with matter having negligible velocity. It is sometimes urged against de Sitter’s world that it becomes non-statical as
soon as any matter is inserted in it. But this property is perhaps rather
in favour of de Sitter’s theory than against it.
One of the most perplexing problems of cosmogony is the great
speed of the spiral nebulae. Their radial velocities average about
600 km. per sec. and there is a great preponderance of velocities of
recession from the solar system. It is usually supposed that these are
the most remote objects known (though this view is opposed by some
authorities), so that here if anywhere we might look for effects due to a
general curvature of the world. De Sitter’s theory gives a double explanation of this motion of recession; first, there is the general tendency
to scatter according to equation (70.22); second, there is the general
displacement of spectral lines to the red in distant objects due to the
slowing down of atomic vibrations (67.4) which would be erroneously
interpreted as a motion of recession.
The most extensive measurements of radial velocities of spiral nebulae have been made by Prof. V. M. Slipher at the Lowell Observatory.
He has kindly prepared for me the following table, containing many unpublished results. It is believed to be complete up to date (Feb. 1922).
For the nebulae marked (*) the results have been closely confirmed at
other observatories; those marked (†) are not so accurate as the others.
The number in the first column refers to the “New General Catalogue,”
Memoirs R.A.S., vol. 49. One additional nebula n.g.c. 1700 has been
observed by Pease, who found a large receding velocity but gave no
numerical estimate.
The great preponderance of positive (receding) velocities is very
ch. v properties of de sitter’s spherical world 274
striking; but the lack of observations of southern nebulae is unfortunate, and forbids a final conclusion. Even if these also show a preponderance of receding velocities the cosmogonical difficulty is perhaps
not entirely removed by de Sitter’s theory. It will be seen that two∗
nebulae (including the great Andromeda nebula) are approaching with
rather high velocity and these velocities happen to be exceptionally
well determined. In the full formula (70.21) there are no terms which
under any reasonable conditions encourage motion towards the origin†
.
It is therefore difficult to account for these motions even as exceptional
phenomena; on the other hand an approaching velocity of 300 km.
per sec. is about the limit occasionally attained by individual stars or
star clusters.
The conservation of energy is satisfied in de Sitter’s world; but from
the practical standpoint it is abrogated in large scale problems such
as that of the system of the spirals, since these are able to withdraw
kinetic energy from a source not generally taken into account.

The orbit is the same as that of a particle under a repulsive force varying
directly as the distance. (This applies only to the form of the orbit,
not to the velocity in the orbit.) For the motion of light the constant
of areas h is infinite, and the tracks of light-rays are the solutions of
d
2u
dφ2
+ u = 0,
i.e. straight lines. Determination of distance by parallax-measurements
rests on the assumption that light is propagated in straight lines, and
hence the method is exact in this system of coordinates. In so far
as the distances of celestial objects are determined by parallaxes or
parallactic motions, the coordinate r will agree with their accepted distances. This result may be contrasted with the solution for the field
of a particle in § 38 where the coordinate r has no immediate observational significance. Radial distances determined by direct operations
with measuring-rods correspond to Rχ, not r.
The spectroscopic radial velocity is not exactly equivalent to dr/dt,
but the divergence is unimportant. A pulse of light emitted by an atom
situated at r = R sin χ at time t will reach the observer at the origin
at time t

The first term represents the general shift to the red dependent on
position and not on velocity. Assuming that it has been allowed for,
the remaining part of the shift corresponds to a velocity of sec3 χ

instead of dr
dt. The correction is scarcely of practical importance.
The acceleration 1

taken by the light from the object to reach the origin, would cause a
change of velocity of the order 1
3
λr2 or r
2/R2
. The Doppler effect of this
velocity would be roughly the same as the shift to the red caused by the
slowing down of atomic vibrations. We may thus regard the red shift
for distant objects at rest as an anticipation of the motion of recession
which will have been attained before we receive the light. If de Sitter’s
interpretation of the red shift in the spiral nebulae is correct, we need
not regard the deduced large motions of recession as entirely fallacious;
it is true that the nebulae had not these motions when they emitted
ch. v properties of de sitter’s spherical world 277
the light which is now examined, but they have acquired them by now.
Even the standing still of time on the horizon becomes intelligible from
this point of view; we are supposed to be observing a system which has
now the velocity of light, having acquired it during the infinite time
which has elapsed since the observed light was emitted.
The following paradox is sometimes found puzzling. Take coordinates for an observer A at rest at the origin, and let B be at rest at the
time t at a considerable distance from the origin. The vibrations of an
atom at B are slower (as measured in the time t) than those of an atom
at A, and since the coordinate-system is static this difference will be
detected experimentally by any observer who measures the frequency
of the light he receives. Accordingly B must detect the difference, and
conclude that the light from A is displaced towards the violet relatively
to his standard atom. This is absurd since, if we choose B as origin, the
light from A should be displaced towards the red. The fallacy lies in ignoring what has happened during the long time of propagation from A
to B or B to A; during this time the two observers have ceased to be
in relative rest, so that compensating Doppler effects are superposed.
To obtain a clearer geometrical idea of de Sitter’s world, we consider
only one dimension of space, neglecting the coordinatesθ and φ. Then
by (67.31)
−ds2 = R
2
(dω2 + sin2 ω dζ2
) = R
2
(dχ2 − cos2 χ dt2
)
= dx2 + dy2 + dz2
,
where
x = R sin ω cos ζ = R cos χ sin it,
y = R sin ω sin ζ = R sin χ,
z = R cos ω = R cos χ cosit,
ch. v properties of de sitter’s spherical world 278
and
x
2 + y
2 + z
2 = R
2
.
It will be seen that real values of χ and t correspond to imaginary
values of ω and ζ and accordingly for real events x is imaginary and
y and z are real. Introducing a real coordinate ξ = −ix, real space-time
will be represented by the hyperboloid of one sheet with its axis along
the axis of ξ,
y
2 + z
2 − ξ
2 = R
2
,
the geometry being of the Galilean type
ds2 = dξ2 − dy2 − dz2
.
We have
r = R sin χ = y,
tanh t = −itan it = −ix/z = ξ/z,
so that the space-partitions are made by planes perpendicular to the
axis of y, and the time-partitions by planes through the axis of y cutting
the hyperboloid into lunes.
The light-tracks, ds = 0, are the generators of the hyperboloid.
The tracks of undisturbed particles are (non-Euclidean) geodesics on
the hyperboloid; and, except for y = 0, the space-partitions will not be
geodesics, so that particles do not remain at rest.
The coordinate-frame (r, t) of a single observer does not cover the
whole world. The range from t = −∞ to t = +∞ corresponds to
values of ξ/z between ±1. The whole experience of any one observer of
infinite longevity is comprised within a 90◦
lune. Changing the origin
we can have another observer whose experience covers a different lune.
The two observers cannot communicate the non-overlapping parts of
ch. v properties of de sitter’s spherical world 279
their experience, since there are no light-tracks (generators) taking the
necessary course.
A further question has been raised, Is de Sitter’s world really empty?
In formula (70.1) there is a singularity at r =
p
3/λ similar to the
singularity at r = 2m in the solution for a particle of matter. Must we
not suppose that the former singularity also indicates matter—a “masshorizon” or ring of peripheral matter necessary in order to distend the
empty region within. If so, it would seem that de Sitter’s world cannot
exist without large quantities of matter any more than Einstein’s; he
has merely swept the dust away into unobserved corners.
A singularity of ds2 does not necessarily indicate material particles,
for we can introduce or remove such singularities by making transformations of coordinates. It is impossible to know whether to blame the
world-structure or the inappropriateness of the coordinate-system. In
a finite region we avoid this difficulty by choosing a coordinate-system
initially appropriate—how this is done is very little understood—and
permitting only transformations which have no singularity in the region. But we can scarcely apply this to a consideration of the whole
finite world since all the ordinary analytical transformations (even a
change of origin) introduce a singularity somewhere. If de Sitter’s form
for an empty world is right it is impossible to find any coordinatesystem which represents the whole of real space-time regularly. This is
no doubt inconvenient for the mathematician, but I do not see that the
objection has any other consequences.
The whole of de Sitter’s world can be reached by a process of continuation; that is to say the finite experience of an observer A extends
over a certain lune; he must then hand over the description to B whose
experience is partly overlapping and partly new; and so on by overlapping lunes. The equation Gµν = λgµν rests on the considerations of
§ 66, and simply by continuation of this equation from point to point we
ch. v properties of einstein’s cylindrical world 280
arrive at de Sitter’s complete world without encountering any barrier
or mass-horizon.
A possible indication that there is no real mass in de Sitter’s world
is afforded by a calculation of the gravitational flux (63.4). By (63.6)
this is
4πr2

−δy −
2
r
δγ
dt,
since dt can no longer be replaced by ds. On substituting for γ it is
found that the flux vanishes for all values of r. It is true that as we
approach the boundary dt/ds becomes very great, but the complete
absence of flux right up to the boundary seems inconsistent with the
existence of a genuine mass-horizon.
I believe then that the mass-horizon is merely an illusion of the observer at the origin, and that it continually recedes as we move towards
it.
71. Properties of Einstein’s cylindrical world.
Einstein does not regard the relation (69.5)
M =
1
2
πR =
1
2
πλ− 1
2 (71.1)
as merely referring to the limiting case when the amount of matter in
the world happens to be sufficient to make the form cylindrical. He
considers it to be a necessary relation between λ and M; so that the
constant λ occurring in the law of gravitation is a function of the total
mass of matter in the world, and the volume of space is conditioned by
the amount of matter contained in it.
The question at once arises, By what mechanism can the value
of λ be adjusted to correspond with M? The creation of a new stellar
ch. v properties of einstein’s cylindrical world 281
system in a distant part of the world would have to propagate to us, not
merely a gravitational field, but a modification of the law of gravitation
itself. We cannot trace the propagation of any such influence, and
the dependence of λ upon distant masses looks like sheer action at a
distance.
But the suggestion is perhaps more plausible if we look at the inverse
relation, viz. M as a function of λ. If we can imagine the gradual
destruction of matter in the world (e.g. by coalescence of positive and
negative electrons), we see by (71.1) that the radius of space gradually
contracts; but it is not clear what is the fixed standard of length by
which R is supposed to be measured. The natural standard of length
in a theoretical discussion is the radius R itself. Choosing it as unit,
we have M =
1
2
π, whatever the number of elementary particles in the
world. Thus with this unit the mass of a particle must be inversely
proportional to the number of particles. Now the gravitational mass is
the radius of a sphere which has some intimate relation to the structure
of the particle; and we must conclude that as the destruction of particles
proceeds, this sphere must swell up as though some pressure were being
relaxed. We might try to represent this pressure by the gravitational
flux (§ 63) which proceeds from every particle; but I doubt whether that
leads to a satisfactory solution. However that may be, the idea that
the particles each endeavour to monopolise all space, and restrain one
another by a mutual pressure, seems to be the simplest interpretation
of (71.1) if it is to be accepted.
We do not know whether the actual (or electrical) radius of the
particle would swell in the same proportion—by a rough guess I should
anticipate that it would depend on the square root of the above ratio.
But this radius, on which the scale of ordinary material standards depends, has nothing to do with equation (71.1); and if we suppose that
it remains constant, the argument of § 66 need not be affected.
ch. v properties of einstein’s cylindrical world 282
In favour of Einstein’s hypothesis is the fact that among the constants of nature there is one which is a very large pure number; this
is typified by the ratio of the radius of an electron to its gravitational
mass = 3 · 1042. It is difficult to account for the occurrence of a pure
number (of order greatly different from unity) in the scheme of things;
but this difficulty would be removed if we could connect it with the
number of particles in the world—a number presumably decided by
pure accident∗
. There is an attractiveness in the idea that the total
number of the particles may play a part in determining the constants
of the laws of nature; we can more readily admit that the laws of the
actual world are specialised by the accidental circumstance of a particular number of particles occurring in it, than that they are specialised
by the same number occurring as a mysterious ratio in the fine-grained
structure of the continuum.
In Einstein’s world one direction is uncurved and this gives a kind of
absolute time. Our critic who has been waiting ever since § 1 with his
blank label “true time” will no doubt seize this opportunity of affixing
it. Moreover absolute velocity is to some extent restored, for there
is by hypothesis a frame of reference with respect to which material
bodies on the average have only small velocities. Matter is essential
to the existence of a space-time frame according to Einstein’s view;
and it is inevitable that the space-time frame should become to some
extent materialised, thereby losing some of the valuable elusiveness of
a purely aetherial frame. It has been suggested that since the amount
of matter necessary for Einstein’s world greatly exceeds that known
to astronomers, most of it is spread uniformly through space and is
∗The square of 3 · 1042 might well be of the same order as the total number of
positive and negative electrons. The corresponding radius is 1014 parsecs. But the
result is considerably altered if we take the proton instead of the electron as the
more fundamental structure.
ch. v properties of einstein’s cylindrical world 283
undetectable by its uniformity. This is dangerously like restoring a
crudely material aether—regulated, however, by the strict injunction
that it must on no account perform any useful function lest it upset
the principle of relativity. We may leave aside this suggestion, which
creates unnecessary difficulties. I think that the matter contemplated
in Einstein’s theory is ordinary stellar matter. Owing to the irregularity
of distribution of stars, the actual form of space is not at all a smooth
sphere, and the formulae are only intended to give an approximation
to the general shape.
The Lorentz transformation continues to hold for a limited region.
Since the advent of the general theory, it has been recognised that
the special theory only applies to particular regions where the gµν can
be treated as constants, so that it scarcely suffers by the fact that it
cannot be applied to the whole domain of spherical space. Moreover
the special principle is now brought into line with the general principle.
The transformations of the theory of relativity relate to the differential
equations of physics; and our tendency to choose simple illustrations
in which these equations are integrable over the whole of space-time
(as simplified in the mathematical example) is responsible for much
misconception on this point.
The remaining features of Einstein’s world require little comment.
His spherical space is commonplace compared with de Sitter’s. Each
observer’s coordinate-system covers the whole world; so that the fields
of their finite experience coincide. There is no scattering force to cause
divergent motions. Light performs the finite journey round the world
in a finite time. There is no passive “horizon,” and in particular no
mass-horizon, real or fictitious. Einstein’s world offers no explanation
of the red shift of the spectra of distant objects; and to the astronomer
this must appear a drawback. For this and other reasons I should be
inclined to discard Einstein’s view in favour of de Sitter’s, if it were not

for the fact that the former appears to offer a distant hope of accounting
for the occurrence of a very large pure number as one of the constants
of nature.
72. The problem of the homogeneous sphere.
For comparison with the results for naturally curved space, we consider a problem in which the curvature is due to the presence of ordinary
matter.

∗Schwarzschild’s solution is of considerable interest; but I do not think that he
solved exactly the problem which he intended to solve, viz. that of an incompressible
fluid. For that reason I do not give the arguments which led to the solution, but
content myself with discussing what distribution of matter his solution represents.
A full account is given by de Donder, La Gravifique Einsteinienne, p. 169 (GauthierVillars, 1921). The original gravitational equations are used, the natural curvature
of space being considered negligible compared with that superposed by the material

We see that the pressure vanishes at r = a, and would become
negative if we attempted to continue the solution beyond r = a. Hence
the sphere r = a gives the boundary of the fluid. If it is desired to
continue the solution outside the sphere, another form of ds2 must be
taken corresponding to the equations for empty spa

Unless a > p
8/9α the pressure will everywhere be finite. This
condition sets an upper limit to the possible size of a fluid sphere of
given density. The limit exists because the presence of dense matter
increases the curvature of space, and makes the total volume of space
smaller. Clearly the volume of the material sphere cannot be larger
than the volume of space.
For spheres which are not unduly large (e.g. not much larger than
the stars) this solution corresponds approximately to the problem of
the equilibrium of an incompressible fluid. The necessary conditions
are satisfied, viz.
(1) The density is uniform.
(2) The pressure is zero at the surface.
(3) The stress-system is an isotropic hydrostatic pressure, and therefore satisfies the conditions of a perfect fluid.
(4) The pressure is nowhere infinite, negative, or imaginary.
Further equation (72.4) determines the pressure at any distance
from the centre.
But the problem is only solved approximately, and the material
here discussed is not strictly incompressible nor is it a perfect fluid.

refer to the particular coordinates used;
these are arbitrary and do not correspond to natural measure. So long
as the sphere is small, the difference does not amount to much; but
for large spheres the solution ceases to correspond to a problem of any
physical importance since it does not refer to natural measure. It is
unfortunate that the solution breaks down for large spheres, because
the existence of a limit to the size of the sphere is one of the most
interesting objects of the research.
Clearly we need a solution in which the density referred to natural
measure is constant throughout; i.e. T constant, instead of T

constant.
The condition for a perfect fluid also needs modification. (But it would
ch. v the problem of the homogeneous sphere 287
be of considerable interest to find the solution for a solid capable of
supporting non-isotropic stress, if the problem of the fluid proves too
difficult.) So far as I know, no progress has been made with the exact solution of this problem. It would throw interesting light on the
manner in which the radius of space contracts as the size of the sphere
continually increases.
If it is assumed that Schwarzschild’s result
a < p
8/9α
is correct as regards order of magnitude, the radius of the greatest
possible mass of water would be 370 million kilometres. The radius of
the star Betelgeuse is something like half of this; but its density is much
too small to lead to any interesting applications of the foregoing result.
Admitting Einstein’s modification of the law of gravitation, with
λ depending on the total amount of matter in the world, the size of
the greatest sphere is easily determined. By (69.4) R2 = 1/4πρ0, from
which R (for water) is very nearly 300 million kilometres.

ELECTRICITY
73. The electromagnetic equations.
In the classical theory the electromagnetic field is described by a
scalar potential Φ and a vector potential (F, G, H). The electric force
(X, Y, Z) and the magnetic force (α, β, γ) are derived from these according to the equations

(73.1)
The classical theory does not consider any possible interaction between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields. Accordingly these
definitions, together with Maxwell’s equations, are intended to refer to
the case in which no field of force is acting, i.e. to Galilean coordinates.
We take a special system of Galilean coordinates and set
κ
µ = (F, G, H, Φ) (73.21)
for that system. Having decided to make κ
µ a contravariant vector we
can find its components in any other system of coordinates, Galilean or
otherwise, by the usual transformation law; but, of course, we cannot
ch. vi the electromagnetic equations 290
tell without investigation what would be the physical interpretation
of those components. In particular we must not assume without proof
that the components of κ
µ
in another Galilean system would agree with
the new F, G, H, Φ determined experimentally for that system. At
the present stage, we have defined κ
µ
in all systems of coordinates, but
the equation (73.21) connecting it with experimental quantities is only
known to hold for one particular Galilean system.
Lowering the suffix with Galilean gµν, we have
κµ = (−F, −G, −H, Φ). (73.22)
Let the tensor
Fµν ≡ κµν − κνµ =
∂κµ

Let ρ be the density of electric charge and σx, σy, σz the density of

Here again we must not assume that the components of J

in the original system of coordinates.

The Heaviside-Lorentz unit of charge is used so that the factor 4π does
not appear. The velocity of light is as usual taken to be unity. Specific inductive capacity and magnetic permeability are merely devices
ch. vi the electromagnetic equations 292
employed in obtaining macroscopic equations, and do not occur in the
exact theory.
It will be seen by reference to (73.41) and (73.42) that Maxwell’s
equations are equivalent to

The first comprises the four equations (73.61) and (73.64); and the
second comprises (73.62) and (73.63).
On substituting Fµν = ∂κµ/∂xν − ∂κν∂xµ in (73.71) it will be seen
that the equation is satisfied identically. Also (73.72) is the simplified
form for Galilean coordinates of (F

The divergence of the charge-and-current vector vanishes.
For our original coordinates (73.77) becomes

∂ρ
∂t = 0. (73.78)
If the current is produced by the motion of the charge with velocity

It may be noted that even in non-Galilean coordinates the chargeand-current vector satisfies the strict law of conservation

This may be contrasted with the material energy and momentum which,
it will be remembered, do not in the general case satisfy

so that it becomes necessary to supplement them by the pseudo-energytensor t

The bracket constitutes a contravariant vector; consequently ρ ds/dt is
an invariant. Now ds/dt represents the FitzGerald contraction, so that
a volume which would be measured as unity by an observer moving
with the charge will be measured as ds/dt by an observer at rest in the
coordinates chosen. The invariant ρ ds/dt is the amount of charge in
this volume, i.e. unit proper-volume.
We write
ρ0 = ρ

so that ρ0 is the proper-density of the charge. If Aµ
is the velocityvector dxµ/ds of the charge, then (73.81) becomes
J
µ = ρ0A
µ
. (73.82)
Charge, unlike mass, is not altered by motion relative to the observer. This follows from the foregoing result that the amount of charge
in an absolutely defined volume (unit proper-volume) is an invariant.
The reason for this difference of behaviour of charge and mass will be
understood by reference to (53.2) where the FitzGerald factor ds/dt
occurs squared.

For the observer S using our original system of Galilean coordinates,
the quantities kµ, Fµν and J

obtained by the transformation-laws; but we have not yet shown that
these are the quantities which S
0 will measure when he makes experimental determinations of potential, force, and current relative to his
moving apparatus. Now if S
0
recognises certain measured quantities
as potential, force, and current it must be because they play the same
part in the world relative to him, as κµ, Fµν and J
µ play in the world
relative to S. To play the same part means to have the same properties, or fulfil the same relations or equations. But κ

’s coordinates as κµ, Fµν and J
µ do in
S’s coordinates, because the fundamental equations (73.73), (73.74) and
(73.77) are tensor equations holding in all systems of coordinates. The
fact that Maxwell’s equations are tensor equations, enables us to make
the identification of κµ, Fµν, J
µ with the experimental potential, force,
and current in all systems of Galilean coordinates and not merely in
the system initially chosen.
In one sense our proof is not yet complete. There are other equations
obeyed by the electromagnetic variables which have not yet been discussed. In particular there is the equation which prescribes the motion
of a particle carrying a charge in the electromagnetic field. We shall
show in § 76 that this also is of the tensor form, so that the accented
variables continue to play the same part in S
0
’s experience which the
unaccented variables play in S’s experience. But even as it stands our
proof is sufficient to show that if there exists for S
0 a potential, force,
and current precisely analogous to the potential, force, and current of S,
these must be expressed by κ
0
µ
, Fµν, J
0µ
, because other quantities would
not satisfy the equations already obtained. The proviso must clearly
ch. vi electromagnetic waves 296
be fulfilled unless the special principle of relativity is violated.
When an observer uses non-Galilean coordinates, he will as usual
treat them as though they were Galilean and attribute all discrepancies
to the effects of the field of force which is introduced. κµ, Fµν and J
µ
will be identified with the potential, force, and current, just as though
the coordinates were Galilean. These quantities will no longer accurately obey Maxwell’s original form of the equations, but will conform
to our generalised tensor equations (73.73) and (73.74). The replacement of (73.72) by the more general form (73.74) extends the classical
equations to the case in which a gravitational field of force is acting in
addition to the electromagnetic field.
74. Electromagnetic waves.
(a) Propagation of electromagnetic potential.
It is well known that the electromagnetic potentials F, G, H, Φ
are not determinate. They are concerned in actual phenomena only
through their curl—the electromagnetic force. The curl is unaltered, if
we replace
−F, −G, −H, Φ by − F +
∂V
∂x , −G +
∂V
∂y , −H +
∂V
∂z , Φ + ∂V
∂t ,
where V is an arbitrary function of the coordinates. The latter expression gives the same field of electromagnetic force and may thus equally
well be adopted for the electromagnetic potentials.
It is usual to avoid this arbitrariness by selecting from the possible
values the set which satisfies
∂F
∂x +
∂G
∂y +
∂H
∂z +
∂Φ
∂t = 0.
ch. vi electromagnetic waves 297
Similarly in general coordinates we remove the arbitrariness of κµ by
imposing the condition
(κ
µ
)µ = 0. (74.1)
When the boundary-condition at infinity is added, the value of κµ becomes completely determinate.

In empty space this becomes

If the law of gravitation Gµν = λgµν for curved space-time is
adopted, the equation in empty space becomes
( + λ)κµ = 0. (74.33)
(b) Propagation of electromagnetic force.
To determine a corresponding law of propagation of Fµν we naturally
try to take the curl of (74.31); but care is necessary since the order of
the operations curl and  is not interchangeable.

It need not surprise us that the velocity of propagation of electromagnetic potential and of electromagnetic force is not the same (cf. (74.33)
and (74.43)). The former is not physically important since it involves
the arbitrary convention κ
α
α = 0.
But the result (74.42) is, I think, unexpected. It shows that the
equations of propagation of electromagnetic force involve the RiemannChristoffel tensor; and therefore this is not one of the phenomena for
which the ordinary Galilean equations can be immediately generalised
by the principle of equivalence. This naturally makes us uneasy as
to whether we have done right in adopting the invariant equations of
propagation of light (ds = 0, δ
R
ds = 0) as true in all circumstances;
but the investigation which follows is reassuring.
(c) Propagation of a wave-front.
The conception of a “ray” of light in physical optics is by no means
elementary. Unless the wave-front is of infinite extent, the ray is an
abstraction, and to appreciate its meaning a full discussion of the phenomena of interference fringes is necessary. We do not wish to enter on
such a general discussion here; and accordingly we shall not attempt to
obtain the formulae for the tracks of rays of light for the case of general
coordinates ab initio. Our course will be to reduce the general formulae to such a form, that the subsequent work will follow the ordinary
treatment given in works on physical optics.

κµ = 0, (74.51)
which is the form taken by κµ = 0 in Galilean coordinates. When the
region of space-time is not flat we cannot immediately simplify κµ in
this way; but we can make a considerable simplification by adopting
natural coordinates at the point considered. In that case the 3-index
symbols (but not their derivatives) vanish, and

At first sight this does not look very promising for a justification
of the principle of equivalence. We cannot make all the derivatives
∂{µβ, }/∂xα vanish by any choice of coordinates, since these determine the Riemann-Christoffel tensor. It looks as though the law of
propagation in curved space-time involves the Riemann-Christoffel tensor, and consequently differs from the law in flat space-time. But the
inner multiplication by g
αβ saves the situation. It is possible to choose
coordinates such that g
αβ ∂{µβ, }/∂xα vanishes for all the sixteen possible combinations of µ and 
∗

∗According to (36.55) it is possible by a transformation to increase ∂{µβ, }/∂xα
ch. vi electromagnetic waves 301
to (74.51), and the usual solution for flat space-time will apply at the
point considered.
A solution of (74.51), giving plane waves, is
κµ = Aµ exp
2πi
λ
(lx + my + nz − ct). (74.53)
Here Aµ is a constant vector; l, m, n are direction cosines so that
l
2 +m2 +n
2 = 1. Substituting in (74.51) we find that it will be satisfied
if c
2 = 1 and the first and second derivatives of l, m, n, c vanish. According to the usual discussion of this equation (l, m, n) is the direction
of the ray and c the velocity of propagation along the ray.
The vanishing of first and second derivatives of (l, m, n) shows that
the direction of the ray is stationary at the point considered. (The
light-oscillations correspond to Fµν (not κµ) and the direction of the
ray would not necessarily agree with (l, m, n) if the first derivatives
did not vanish; consequently the stationary property depends on the
vanishing of second derivatives as well.) Further the velocity c along
the ray is unity.
It follows that in any kind of space-time the ray is a geodesic, and
the velocity is such as to satisfy the equation ds = 0. Stated in this
form, the result deduced for a very special system of coordinates must
hold for all coordinate-systems since it is expressed invariantly. The

For an infinitesimal element we may take ρ constant and insert
limits of integration; but these limits must be taken for the time t − r,
and this introduces an important factor representing a kind of Doppler
effect. If the element of charge is bounded by two planes perpendicular
to the direction of r, the limits of integration are from the front plane
at time t−r to the rear plane at time t−r −dr. If vr is the component
velocity in the direction of r, the front plane has had time to advance a
distance vr dr. Consequently the instantaneous thickness of the element
of charge is less than the distance between the limits of integration in

76. Mechanical effects of the electromagnetic field.
According to the elementary laws, a piece of matter carrying electric
charge of density ρ experiences in an electrostatic field a mechanical
force

ch. vi mechanical effects of the electromagnetic field 306
per unit volume. Moving charges constituting electric currents of
amount (σx, σy, σz) per unit volume are acted on by a magnetic field,
so that a mechanical force
γσy − βσz, ασz − γσx, βσx − ασy
per unit volume is experienced.
Hence if (P, Q, R) is the total mechanical force per unit volume
P = ρX + γσy − βσz,
Q = ρY + ασz − γσx,
R = ρZ + βσx − ασy.


(76.1)
The rate at which the mechanical force does work is
S = σxX + σyY + σzZ.
The magnetic part of the force does no work since it acts at right angles
to the current of charged particles.
By (73.41) and (73.5) we find that these expressions are equivalent
to
(P, Q, R, −S) = FµνJ

.
We denote the vector FµνJ
ν by hµ. Raising the suffix with Galilean gµν
we have
(P, Q, R, S) = −h
µ = −F

. (76.2)
The mechanical force will change the momentum and energy of the
material system; consequently the material energy-tensor taken alone
will no longer be conserved. In order to preserve the law of conservation
of momentum and energy, we must recognise that the electric field
contains an electromagnetic momentum and energy whose changes are
ch. vi mechanical effects of the electromagnetic field 307
equal and opposite to those of the material system∗
. The whole energytensor will then consist of two parts, Mν
µ due to the matter and E

to the electromagnetic field.
We keep the notation T

for the whole energy-tensor—the thing
which is always conserved, and is therefore to be identified with

Since P, Q, R, S measure the rate of increase of momentum and
energy of the material system, they may be equated to ∂Mµν/∂xν as
in (53.82). Thus
∂Mµν
∂xν

The equal and opposite change of the momentum and energy of the
electromagnetic field is accordingly given by

∗Notwithstanding the warning conveyed by the fate of potential energy (§ 59) we
are again running into danger by generalising energy so as to conform to an assigned
law. I am not sure that the danger is negligible. But we are on stronger ground
now, because we know that there is a world-tensor which satisfies the assigned law

µ/∂xν = 0, and
it was only a speculative possibility (now found to be untenable) that there existed

Consider a charge moving with velocity (u, v, w). We have by (75.4)
ρX0 = ρX − (ρw)β + (ρv)γ
= ρX − σzβ + σyγ
= P.
The square of the velocity has been neglected, and to this order of
approximation ρ
0 = ρ. Thus to the first order in the velocities, the
mechanical force on a moving charge is (ρ
0X, ρ0Y, ρ0Z); just as the mechanical force on a charge at rest is (ρX, ρY, ρZ). We obtain the force
on the moving charge either by applying the formula (76.1) in the original coordinates, or by transforming to new coordinates in which the
charge is at rest so that σx, σy, σz = 0. The equivalence of the two
calculations is in accordance with the principle of relativity for uniform
motion.
If the square of the velocity is not neglected, no such simple relation
exists. The mechanical force (mass × acceleration) will not be exactly
the same in the accented and unaccented systems of coordinates, since
the mass and acceleration are altered by terms involving the square of
the velocity. In fact we could not expect any accurate relation between
the mechanical force (P, Q, R) and the electric force (X, Y, Z) in different systems of coordinates; the former is part of a vector, and the
latter part of a tensor of the second rank.
Perhaps it might have been expected that with the advent of the
electron theory of matter it would become unnecessary to retain a separate material energy-tensor Mµν, and that the whole energy and momentum could be included in the energy-tensor of the electromagnetic
ch. vi the electromagnetic energy-tensor 309
field. But we cannot dispense with Mµν. The fact is that an electron
must not be regarded as a purely electromagnetic phenomenon; that
is to say, something enters into its constitution which is not comprised
in Maxwell’s theory of the electromagnetic field. In order to prevent
the electronic charge from dispersing under its own repulsion, nonMaxwellian “binding forces” are necessary, and it is the energy, stress
and momentum of these binding forces which constitute the material
energy-tensor Mµν
.

The last gives the energy or mass of the electromagnetic field; the third
expression gives the momentum; the first two give the stresses in the
field. In all cases these formulae agree with those of the classical theory.
Momentum, being rate of flow of mass, is also the rate of flow of
energy. In the latter aspect it is often called Poynting’s vector. It
is seen from (77.43) that the momentum is the vector-product of the
electric and magnetic forces—to use the terminology of the elementary
vector theory.
From E

µ we can form a scalar E by contraction, just as T is formed

ch. vi the electromagnetic energy-tensor 311

latter from the matter or non-Maxwellian stresses involved in the electron. It turns out, however, that E is identically zero, so that the
electromagnetic field contributes nothing to the invariant density. The
invariant density must be attributed entirely to the non-Maxwellian

The question of the origin of the inertia of matter presents a very
curious paradox. We have to distinguish—
the invariant mass m arising from the invariant density T, and
the relative mass M arising from the coordinate density T
44
.
As we have seen, the former cannot be attributed to the electromagnetic
field. But it is generally believed that the latter—which is the ordinary
mass as understood in physics—arises solely from the electromagnetic
fields of the electrons, the inertia of matter being simply the energy
of the electromagnetic fields contained in it. It is probable that this
view, which arose in consequence of J. J. Thomson’s researches∗
, is
correct; so that ordinary or relative mass may be regarded as entirely
electromagnetic, whilst invariant mass is entirely non-electromagnetic.
How then does it happen that for an electron at rest, invariant mass
and relative mass are equal, and indeed synonymous?
Probably the distinction of Maxwellian and non-Maxwellian stresses
as tensors of different natures is artificial—like the distinction of gravitational and inertial fields—and the real remedy is to remodel the
∗Phil. Mag. vol. 11 (1881), p. 229.
ch. vi the electromagnetic energy-tensor 312
electromagnetic equations so as to comprehend both in an indissoluble
connection. But so long as we are ignorant of the laws obeyed by the
non-Maxwellian stresses, it is scarcely possible to avoid making the separation. From the present point of view we have to explain the paradox
as follows—
Taking an electron at rest, the relative mass is determined solely by
the component E
44; but the stress-components of E
µν make a contribution to E which exactly cancels that of E
44, so that E = 0. These
stresses are balanced by non-Maxwellian stresses M11
, . . . , M33; the
balancing being not necessarily exact in each element of volume, but
exact for the region round the electron taken as a whole. Thus the term
which cancels E
44 is itself cancelled, and E
44 becomes reinstated. The
final result is that the integral of T is equal to the integral of E
44 for
the electron at rest.
It is usually assumed that the non-Maxwellian stresses are confined
to the interior, or the close proximity, of the electrons, and do not
wander about in the detached way that the Maxwellian stresses do,
e.g. in light-waves. I shall adopt this view in order not to deviate too
widely from other writers, although I do not see any particular reason
for believing it to be true∗
.
If then all non-Maxwellian stresses are closely bound to the electrons, it follows that in regions containing no matter E
ν

is the entire
energy-tensor. Then (54.3) becomes

∗We may evade the difficulty by extending the definition of electrons or matter to
include all regions where Maxwell’s equations are inadequate (e.g. regions containing
quanta).
ch. vi the gravitational field of an electron 313
and the equation simplifies to
Gµν = −8πEµν (77.7)
for regions containing electromagnetic fields but no matter. We may
notice that the Gaussian curvature of space-time is zero even when
electromagnetic energy is present provided there are no electrons in the
region.
Since for electromagnetic energy the invariant mass, m, is zero, and
the relative mass, M, is finite, the equation (12.3)
M = m
dt
ds
shows that ds/dt is zero. Accordingly free electromagnetic energy must
always have the velocity of light.
78. The gravitational field of an electron.
This problem differs from that of the gravitational field of a particle
(§ 38) in that the electric field spreads through all space, and consequently the energy-tensor is not confined to a point or small sphere at
the origin.

This result appears to have been first given by Nordstr¨om. I have
here followed the solution as given by G. B. Jeffery∗
.
The effect of the term 4π2/r2
is that the effective mass decreases
as r decreases. This is what we should naturally expect because the
mass or energy is spread throughout space. We cannot put the constant m equal to zero, because that would leave a repulsive force on
an uncharged particle varying as the inverse cube of the distance; by
(55.8) the approximate Newtonian potential is m/r − 2π2/r2
.
The constant m can be identified with the mass and 4π with the
electric charge of the particle. The known experimental values for the
negative electron are
m = 7 · 10−56 cm.,
a =
2π2
m
= 1.5 · 10−13 cm.
The quantity a is usually considered to be of the order of magnitude
of the radius of the electron, so that at all points outside the electron
m/r is of order 10−40 or smaller. Since λ + ν = 0, (78.4) becomes

which justifies our identification of 4π with the electric charge.
This example shows how very slight is the gravitational effect of
the electronic energy. We can discuss most electromagnetic problems
without taking account of the non-Euclidean character which an electromagnetic field necessarily imparts to space-time, the deviations from
Euclidean geometry being usually so small as to be negligible in the
cases we have to consider.
When r is diminished the value of γ given by (78.6) decreases to a
minimum for r = 2a, and then increases continually becoming infinite
at r = 0. There is no singularity in the electromagnetic and gravitational fields except at r = 0. It is thus possible to have an electron
which is strictly a point-singularity, but nevertheless has a finite mass
and charge.
The solution for the gravitational field of an uncharged particle is
quite different in this respect. There is a singularity at r = 2m, so that
the particle must have a finite perimeter not less than 4πm. Moreover
this singularity is caused by γ vanishing, whereas for the point-electron
the singularity is due to γ becoming infinite.
This demonstration that a point-electron may have exactly the
properties which electrons are observed to have is a useful corrective
to the general belief that the radius of an electron is known with certainty. But on the whole, I think that it is more likely that an electron
is a structure of finite size; our solution will then only be valid until we
enter the substance of the electron, so that the question of a singularity
at the origin does not arise.
Assuming that we do not encounter the substance of the electron
outside the sphere r = a, the total energy of the electromagnetic field
beyond this radius would be equal to the mass of the electron determined by observation. For this reason a is usually taken as the radius of
the electron. If it is admitted that the electromagnetic field continues
ch. vi electromagnetic action 317
undisturbed within this limit, an excess of energy accumulates, and it
is therefore necessary to suppose that there exists negative energy in
the inner portion, or that the effect of the singularity is equivalent to a
negative energy. The conception of negative energy is not very welcome
according to the usual outlook.
Another reason for believing that the charge of an electron is distributed through a volume of radius roughly equal to a will be found in
the investigation of § 80. Accordingly I am of opinion that the pointelectron is no more than a mathematical curiosity, and that the solution (78.6) should be limited to values of r greater than a.

In the mechanical theory, neglecting electromagnetic fields, we
found that the action G was stationary in regions containing no matter. We now see that when electromagnetic fields are included, the
quantity which is stationary is G − 4πF µνFµν. Moreover it is stationary for variations δκµ as well as δgµν, since when there are no electrons
present J
µ must be zero.
The quantity G − 4πF µνFµν thus appears to be highly significant
from the physical point of view, in the discrimination between matter
(electrons) and electromagnetic fields. But this significance fails to
appear in the analytical expression. Analytically the combination of
the two invariants G and F
µνFµν—the one a spur, and the other a
square of a length—appears to be quite nonsensical. We can only regard
the present form of the expression as a stepping-stone to something
simpler. It will appear later that G − 4πF µνFµν is perhaps not the
exact expression for the significant physical quantity; it may be an
approximation to a form which is analytically simpler, in which the
gravitational and electromagnetic variables appear in a more intelligible
combination.
Whereas material and gravitational actions are two aspects of the
same thing, electromagnetic action stands entirely apart. There is no
gravitational action associated with an electromagnetic field, owing to
the identity E = 0. Thus any material or gravitational action is additional to electromagnetic action—if “addition” is appropriate in connection with quantities which are apparently of dissimilar nature.
80. Explanation of the mechanical force.
Why does a charged particle move when it is placed in an electromagnetic field? We may be tempted to reply that the reason is obvious;
there is an electric force lying in wait, and it is the nature of a force
ch. vi explanation of the mechanical force 321
to make bodies move. But this is a confusion of terminology; electric
force is not a force in the mechanical sense of the term; it has nothing to
do with pushing and pulling. Electric force describes a world-condition
essentially different from that described by a mechanical force or stresssystem; and the discussion in § 76 was based on empirical laws without
theoretical explanation.
If we wish for a representation of the state of the aether in terms of
mechanical forces, we must employ the stress-system (77.41, 77.42). In
fact the pulling and pushing property is described by the tensor Eµν not
by Fµν. Our problem is to explain why a somewhat arbitrary combination of the electromagnetic variables Fµν should have the properties of
a mechanical stress-system.
To reduce the problem to its simplest form we consider an isolated
electron. In an electromagnetic field its world-line does not follow a
geodesic, but deviates according to laws which have been determined
experimentally. It is worth noticing that the behaviour of an isolated
electron has been directly determined by experiment, this being one of
the few cases in which microscopic laws have been found immediately
and not inferred hypothetically from macroscopic experiments. We
want to know what the electron is trying to accomplish by deviating
from the geodesic—what condition of existence is fulfilled, which makes
the four-dimensional structure of an accelerated electron a possible one,
whereas a similar structure ranged along a geodesic track would be an
impossible one.

We have replaced the density ρ0 by the quantity e for the reason explained in the footnote.

The discussion of § 78 shows that we may safely neglect the gravitational field caused by the energy of the electron or of the external field.

The observed law of motion of the electron thus corresponds to the
condition that it can be under no resultant electromagnetic field. We
must not imagine that a resultant electromagnetic force has anything of
a tugging nature that can deflect an electron. It never gets the chance
of doing anything to the electron, because if the resultant field existed
the electron could not exist—it would be an impossible structure.
The interest of this discussion is that it has led us to one of the
conditions for the existence of an electron, which turns out to be of
a simple character—viz. that on the average the electromagnetic force
throughout the electron must be zero∗
. This condition is clearly fulfilled
∗The exact region of zero force is not determined. The essential point is that
ch. vi explanation of the mechanical force 325
for a symmetrical electron at rest in no field of force; and the same
condition applied generally leads to the law of motion (80.1).
For the existence of an electron, non-Maxwellian stresses are necessary, and we are not yet in a position to state the laws of these
additional stresses. The existence of an electron contradicts the electromagnetic laws with which we have to work at present, so that from
the present standpoint an electron at rest in no external field of force is
a miracle. Our calculation shows that an electron in an external field
of force having the acceleration given by (80.1) is precisely the same
miracle. That is as far as the explanation goes.
The electromagnetic field within the electron will vanish on the average if it has sufficient symmetry. There appears to be an analogy
between this and the condition which we found in § 56 to be necessary
for the existence of a particle, viz. that its gravitational field should
have symmetrical properties. There is further an analogy in the condition determining the acceleration in the two cases. An uncharged
undisturbed body takes such a course that relative to it there is no
resultant gravitational field; similarly an electron takes such a course
that relative to it there is no resultant electromagnetic field. We have
given a definite reason for the gravitational symmetry of a particle, viz.
because in practical measurement it is itself the standard of symmetry;
I presume that there is an analogous explanation of the electrical symmetry of an electron, but it has not yet been formulated. The following
argument (which should be compared with §§ 64, 66) will show where
the difficulty occurs.
The analogue of the interval is the flux Fµν dSµν. As the interval
between two adjacent points is the fundamental invariant of mechanics,
on some critical surface or volume the field has to be symmetrical enough to give
no resultant.
ch. vi explanation of the mechanical force 326
so the flux through a small surface is the fundamental invariant of electromagnetism. Two electrical systems will be alike observationally if,
and only if, all corresponding fluxes are equal. Equality of flux can thus
be tested absolutely; and different fluxes can be measured (according to
a conventional code) by apparatus constituted with electrical material.
From the flux we can pass by mathematical processes to the chargeand-current vector, and this enables us to make the second contact
between mathematical theory and the actual world, viz. the identification of electricity. We should now complete the cycle by showing that
with electricity so defined apparatus can be constructed which will measure the original flux. Here, however, the analogy breaks down, at least
temporarily. The use of electricity for measuring electromagnetic fluxes
requires discontinuity, but this discontinuity is obtained in practice by
complicated conditions such as insulation, constant contact differences
of potential, etc. We do not seem able to reduce the theory of electrical
measurement to direct dependence on an innate discontinuity of electrical charge in the same way that geometrical measurement depends
on the discontinuity of matter. For this reason the last chain of the cycle is incomplete, and it does not seem permissible to deduce that the
discontinuous unit of electric charge must become the standard of electrical symmetry in the same way that the discontinuous unit of matter
(turned in different orientations) becomes the standard of geometrical
symmetry.
According to (80.6) the mass of the electron is e
2/4πa, where a is a
length comparable with the radius of the electron. This is in conformity
with the usual view as to the size of an electron, and is opposed to the
point-electron suggested in § 78 as an alternative. But the mass here
considered is a purely electromagnetic constant, which only enters into
equations in which electromagnetic forces are concerned. When the
right-hand side of (80.1) vanishes, the electron describes a geodesic
ch. vi explanation of the mechanical force 327
just as an uncharged particle would; but m is now merely a constant
multiplier which can be removed. We have still to find the connection
between this electromagnetic mass
me = e

/4πa (80.71)
and the gravitational (i.e. gravitation-producing) mass mg, given by
mg ds =
1
8π
Z
G
√
−g dτ. (80.72)
Since we believe that all negative electrons are precisely alike,
mg/me will be a constant for the negative electron; similarly it will
be a constant for the positive electron. But positive and negative
electrons are structures of very different kinds, and it does not follow
that mg/me is the same for both. As a matter of fact there is no
experimental evidence which suggests that the ratio is the same for
both. Any gravitational field perceptible to observation is caused by
practically equal numbers of positive and negative electrons, so that no
opportunity of distinguishing their contributions occurs. If, however,
we admit that the principle of conservation of energy is universally
valid in cases where the positive and negative electrons are separated
to an extent never yet realised experimentally, it is possible to prove
that mg/me is the same for both kinds.
From the equation (80.1) we deduce the value of the electromagnetic energy-tensor as in §§ 76, 77; only, E

the same units as the whole energy-tensor Gν

We can establish this equation firstly by considering the motion of a
positive electron and secondly by considering a negative electron. Evidently we shall obtain inconsistent equations in the two cases unless
mg/me for the positive electron is the same as for the negative electron. Unless this condition is fulfilled, we should violate the law of
conservation of energy and momentum by first converting kinetic energy of a negative electron into free electromagnetic energy and then
reconverting the free energy into kinetic energy of a positive electron.
Accordingly mg/me is a constant of nature and it may be absorbed
in equation (80.8) by properly choosing the unit of Fµν.
81. Electromagnetic volume.
If aµν is any tensor, the determinant |aµν| is transformed according
to the law

by (48.8), whence it follows as in (49.3) that
Z q
|aµν| dτ (81.1)
for any four-dimensional region is an invariant.
We have already considered the case a aµν = gµν, and it is natural
now to consider the case aµν = Fµν. Since the tensor gµν defines the
metric of space-time, and the corresponding invariant is the metrical
volume (natural volume) of the region, it seems appropriate to call the
invariant
Ve =
Z q
|Fµν| dτ (81.2)
the electromagnetic volume of the region. The resemblance to metrical
volume is purely analytical.
ch. vi macroscopic equations 329
Since |Fµν| is a skew-symmetric determinant of even order, it is a
perfect square, and (81.2) is rational. It easily reduces to
Ve =
Z
(F23F14 + F31F24 + F12F34) dτ. (81.31)
In Galilean coordinates this becomes
Ve =
Z
(αX + βY + γZ) dτ. (81.32)
It is somewhat curious that the scalar-product of the electric and
magnetic forces is of so little importance in the classical theory, for
(81.32) would seem to be the most fundamental invariant of the field.
Apart from the fact that it vanishes for electromagnetic waves propagated in the absence of any bound electric field (i.e. remote from electrons), this invariant seems to have no significant properties. Perhaps
it may turn out to have greater importance when the study of electronstructure is more advanced.
From (81.31) we have

Hence Ve reduces to a surface-integral over the boundary of the region,
and it is useless to consider its variations by the Hamiltonian method.
The electromagnetic volume of a region is of the nature of a flux through
its three-dimensional boundary.

82. Macroscopic equations.
For macroscopic treatment the distribution and motion of the electrons are averaged, and the equivalent continuous distribution is described by two new quantities
the electric displacement, P, Q, R,
the magnetic induction, a, b, c,
in addition to
the electric force, X, Y , Z,
the magnetic force, α, β, γ.
These are grouped cross-wise to form the two principal electromagnetic
tensors

Hµν now plays the part previously taken by F
µν; but it is no longer
derived from Fµν by a mere raising of suffixes. The relation between
the two tensors is given by the constitutive equations of the material;
in simple cases it is specified by two constants, the specific inductive
capacity κ and the permeability µ.

The macroscopic method is introduced for practical purposes rather
than as a contribution to the theory, and there seems to be no advantage
in developing it further here. The chief theoretical interest lies in the
suggestion of a possible generalisation of Maxwell’s theory by admitting
that the covariant and contravariant electromagnetic tensors may in
certain circumstances be independent tensors, e.g. inside the electron.
This is the basis of a theory of matter developed by G. Mie.
CHAPTER VII
WORLD GEOMETRY
Part I. Weyl’s Theory
83. Natural geometry and world geometry.
Graphical representation is a device commonly employed in dealing with all kinds of physical quantities. It is most often used when
we wish to set before ourselves a mass of information in such a way
that the eye can take it in at a glance; but this is not the only use.
We do not always draw the graphs on a sheet of paper; the method
is also serviceable when the representation is in a conceptual mathematical space of any number of dimensions and possibly non-Euclidean
geometry. One great advantage is that when the graphical representation has been made, an extensive geometrical nomenclature becomes
available for description—straight line, gradient, curvature, etc.—and
a self-explanatory nomenclature is a considerable aid in discussing an
abstruse subject.
It is therefore reasonable to seek enlightenment by giving a graphical representation to all the physical quantities with which we have
to deal. In this way physics becomes geometrised. But graphical representation does not assume any hypothesis as to the ultimate nature
of the quantities represented. The possibility of exhibiting the whole
world of physics in a unified geometrical representation is a test not of
ch. vii natural geometry and world geometry 333
the nature of the world but of the ingenuity of the mathematician.
There is no special rule for representing physical quantities such as
electric force, potential, temperature, etc.; we may draw the isotherms
as straight lines, ellipses, spheres, according to convenience of illustration. But there are certain physical quantities (i.e. results of operations and calculations) which have a natural graphical representation;
we habitually think of them graphically, and are almost unconscious
that there is anything conventional in the way we represent them. For
example, measured distances and directions are instinctively conceived
by us graphically; and the space in which we represent them is for us
actual space. These quantities are not in their intrinsic nature dissimilar from other physical quantities which are not habitually represented
geometrically. If we eliminated the human element (or should we not
say, the pre-human element?) in natural knowledge the device of graphical representation of the results of measures or estimates of distance
would appear just as artificial as the graphical representation of thermometer readings. We cannot predict that a superhuman intelligence
would conceive of distance in the way we conceive it; he would perhaps admit that our device of mentally plotting the results of a survey
in a three-dimensional space is ingenious and scientifically helpful, but
it would not occur to him that this space was more actual than the
pv space of an indicator-diagram.
In our previous work we have studied this unsophisticated graphical
representation of certain physical quantities, under the name Natural
Geometry; we have slightly extended the idea by the addition of a
fourth dimension to include time; and we have found that not only
the quantities ordinarily regarded as geometrical but also mechanical
quantities, such as force, density, energy, are fully represented in this
natural geometry. For example the energy-tensor was found to be made
up of the Gaussian curvatures of sections of actual space-time (65.72).
ch. vii natural geometry and world geometry 334
But the electromagnetic quantities introduced in the preceding chapter
have not as yet been graphically represented; the vector κµ was supposed to exist in actual space, not to be the measure of any property
of actual space. Thus up to the present the geometrisation of physics
is not complete.
Two possible ways of generalising our geometrical outlook are open.
It may be that the Riemannian geometry assigned to actual space is
not exact; and that the true geometry is of a broader kind leaving room
for the vector κµ to play a fundamental part and so receive geometrical
recognition as one of the determining characters of actual space. For
reasons which will appear in the course of this chapter, I do not think
that this is the correct solution. The alternative is to give all our
variables, including κµ, a suitable graphical representation in some new
conceptual space—not actual space. With sufficient ingenuity it ought
to be possible to accomplish this, for no hypothesis is implied as to
the nature of the quantities so represented. This generalised graphical
scheme may or may not be helpful to the progress of our knowledge;
we attempt it in the hope that it will render the interconnection of
electromagnetic and gravitational phenomena more intelligible. I think
it will be found that this hope is not disappointed.
In Space, Time and Gravitation, Chapter xi, Weyl’s non-Riemannian
geometry has been regarded throughout as expressing an amended and
exact Natural Geometry. That was the original intention of his theory∗
.
For the present we shall continue to develop it on this understanding.
But we shall ultimately come to the second alternative, as Weyl him-
∗The original paper (Berlin. Sitzungsberichte, 30 May 1918) is rather obscure
on this point. It states the mathematical development of the corrected Riemannian
geometry—“the physical application is obvious.” But it is explicitly stated that the
absence of an electromagnetic field is the necessary condition for Einstein’s theory
to be valid—an opinion which, I think, is no longer held.
ch. vii non-integrability of length 335
self has done, and realise that his non-Riemannian geometry is not
to be applied to actual space-time; it refers to a graphical representation of that relation-structure which is the basis of all physics, and
both electromagnetic and metrical variables appear in it as interrelated.
Having arrived at this standpoint we pass naturally to the more general
geometry of relation-structure developed in Part II of this chapter.
We have then to distinguish between Natural Geometry, which is
the single true geometry in the sense understood by the physicist, and
World Geometry, which is the pure geometry applicable to a conceptual
graphical representation of all the quantities concerned in physics. We
may perhaps go so far as to say that the World Geometry is intended
to be closely descriptive of the fundamental relation-structure which
underlies the various manifestations of space, time, matter and electromagnetism; that statement, however, is rather vague when we come
to analyse it. Since the graphical representation is in any case conventional we cannot say that one method rather than another is right.
Thus the two geometries discussed in Parts I and II of this chapter are
not to be regarded as contradictory. My reason for introducing the second treatment is that I find it to be more illuminating and far-reaching,
not that I reject the first representation as inadmissible.
In the following account of Weyl’s theory I have not adhered to
the author’s order of development, but have adapted it to the point
of view here taken up, which sometimes differs (though not, I believe,
fundamentally) from that which he adopts. It may be somewhat unfair
to present a theory from the wrong end—as its author might consider;
but I trust that my treatment has not unduly obscured the brilliance
of what is unquestionably the greatest advance in the relativity theory
after Einstein’s work.
ch. vii non-integrability of length 336
84. Non-integrability of length.
We have found in § 33 that the change δAµ of a vector taken by
parallel displacement round a small circuit is
δAµ =
1
2
(Aµνσ − Aµσν) dSνσ
=
1


µνσA dSνσ
=

dSνσ
. (84.1)
Hence
A
µ
δAµ =
1
2BµνσA
µA

dSνσ = 0,
since Bµνσ is antisymmetrical in µ and .
Hence by (26.4) δAµ is perpendicular to Aµ, and the length of the
vector Aµ is unaltered by its parallel displacement round the circuit. It
is only the direction which changes.
We endeavoured to explain how this change of direction can occur
in a curved world by the example of a ship sailing on a curved ocean
(§ 33). Having convinced ourselves that there is no logical impossibility
in the result that the direction changes, we cannot very well see anything self-contradictory in the length changing also. It is true that we
have just given a mathematical proof that the length does not change;
but that only means that a change of length is excluded by conditions
which have been introduced, perhaps inadvertently, in the postulates
of Riemannian geometry. We can construct a geometry in which the
change of length occurs, without landing ourselves in a contradiction.
In the more general geometry, we have in place of (84.1)
δAµ =
1
2
∗BµνσA

dSνσ
, (84.21)
ch. vii non-integrability of length 337
where ∗Bµνσ is a more general tensor which is not antisymmetrical in
µ and . It will be antisymmetrical in ν and σ since a symmetrical part
would be meaningless in (84.21), and disappear owing to the antisymmetry of dSνσ. Writing
Rµνσ =
1
2
(
∗Bµνσ −
∗Bνσµ); Fµνσ =

2
(
∗Bµνσ +
∗Bνσµ),
δAµ =
1
2
(Rµνσ + Fµνσ)A

dSνσ
, (84.22)
where R is antisymmetrical, and F symmetrical, in µ and .
Then the change of length l is given by
δ(l
2
) = 2A
µ
δAµ = FµνσA
µA

dSνσ
, (84.3)
which does not vanish.
To obtain Weyl’s geometry we must impose two restrictions on Fµνσ:
(a) Fµνσ is of the special form gµFνσ,
(b) Fνσ is the curl of a vector.
The second restriction is logically necessary. We have expressed the
change of a vector taken round a circuit by a formula involving a surface
bounded by the circuit. We may choose different surfaces, all bounded
by the same circuit; and these have to give the same result for δAµ.
It is easily seen, as in Stokes’s theorem, that these results will only be
consistent if the co-factor of dSνσ is a curl.
The first restriction is not imperatively demanded, and we shall
discard it in Part II of this chapter. It has the following effect. Equation (84.3) becomes
δ(l

) = Fνσ · gµA
µA


dSνσ
,
ch. vii transformation of gauge-systems 338
so that
δl

Fνσ dSνσ
. (84.4)
The change of length is proportional to the original length and is independent of the direction of the vector; whereas in the more general
formula (84.3) the change of length depends on the direction.
One result of the restriction is that zero-length is still zero-length
after parallel displacement round a circuit. If we have identified zerolength at one point of the world we can transfer it without ambiguity
to every other point and so identify zero-length everywhere. Finite
lengths cannot be transferred without ambiguity; a route of parallel
displacement must be specified.
Zero-length is of great importance in optical phenomena, because
in Einstein’s geometry any element of the track of a light-pulse is a
vector of zero-length; so that if there were no definite zero-length a
pulse of light would not know what track it ought to take. It is because
Weyl’s theory makes no attempt to re-interpret this part of Einstein’s
theory that an absolute zero-length is required, and the restriction (a)
is therefore imposed.
Another result of the restriction is that lengths at the same point but
in different orientations become comparable without ambiguity. The
ambiguity is limited to the comparison of lengths at different places.
85. Transformation of gauge-systems.
According to the foregoing section it is not possible to compare
lengths (except zero-length) at different places, because the result of
the comparison will depend on the route taken in bringing the two
lengths into juxtaposition.
ch. vii transformation of gauge-systems 339
In Riemannian geometry we have taken for granted this possibility
of comparing lengths. The interval at any point has been assigned a
definite value, which implies comparison with a standard; it did not
occur to us to question how this comparison at a distance could be
made. We have now to define the geometry of the continuum in a way
which recognises this difficulty.
We suppose that a definite but arbitrary gauge-system has been
adopted; that is to say, at every point of space-time a standard of
interval-length has been set up, and every interval is expressed in terms
of the standard at the point where it is. This avoids the ambiguity
involved in transferring intervals from one point to another to compare
with a single standard.
Take a displacement at P (coordinates, xµ) and transfer it by parallel displacement to an infinitely near point P
0
(coordinates, xµ + dxµ).
Let its initial length measured by the gauge at P be l, and its final
length measured by the gauge at P
0 be l + dl. We may express the
change of length by the formula
d(log l) = κµ dxµ, (85.1)
where κµ represents some vector-field. If we alter the gauge-system we
shall, of course, obtain different values of l, and therefore of κµ.
It is not necessary to specify the route of transfer for the small
distance P to P
0
. The difference in the results obtained by taking
different routes is by (84.4) proportional to the area enclosed by the
routes, and is thus of the second order in dxµ. As P P0
is taken infinitely
small this ambiguity becomes negligible compared with the first-order
expression κµ dxµ.
Our system of reference can now be varied in two ways—by change
of coordinates and by change of gauge-system. The behaviour of gµν
and κµ for transformation of coordinates has been fully studied; we
ch. vii transformation of gauge-systems 340
have to examine how they will be transformed by a transformation of
gauge.
A new gauge-system will be obtained by altering the length of the
standard at each point in the ratio λ, where λ is an arbitrary function of
the coordinates. If the standard is decreased in the ratio λ, the length
of a displacement will be increased in the ratio λ. If accents refer to
the new system
ds0 = λ ds. (85.2)
The components dxµ of a displacement will not be changed, since we
are not altering the coordinate-system, thus
dxµ = dx0
µ
. (85.3)
Hence

Or, writing
φ = log λ, (85.51)
then
κ

. (85.52)
The curl of κµ has an important property; if
Fµν =

−
∂κν
∂xµ
,
we see by (85.52) that
F
0
µν = Fµν, (85.6)
so that Fµν is independent of the gauge-system. This is only true of
the covariant tensor; if we raise one or both suffixes the function λ is
introduced by (85.43).
It will be seen that the geometry of the continuum now involves
14 functions which vary from point to point, viz. ten gµν and four κµ.
These may be subjected to transformations, viz. the transformations
of gauge discussed above, and the transformations of coordinates discussed in Chapter II. Such transformations will not alter any intrinsic
properties of the world; but any changes in the gµν and κµ other than
gauge or coordinate transformations will alter the intrinsic state of the
world and may reasonably be expected to change its physical manifestations.
The question then arises, How will the change manifest itself physically if we alter the κµ? All the phenomena of mechanics have been
traced to the gµν, so that presumably the change is not shown in mechanics, or at least the primary effect is not mechanical. We are left
with the domain of electromagnetism which is not expressible in terms
ch. vii transformation of gauge-systems 342
of gµν alone; and the suggestion arises that an alteration of κµ may
appear physically as an alteration of the electromagnetic field.
We have seen that the electromagnetic field is described by a vector
already called κµ, and it is an obvious step to identify this with the κµ
introduced in Weyl’s geometry. According to observation the physical
condition of the world is not completely defined by the gµν and an
additional vector must be specified; according to theoretical geometry
the nature of a continuum is not completely indicated by the gµν and
an additional vector must be specified. The conclusion is irresistible
that the two vectors are to be identified.
Moreover according to (85.52) we can change κµ to κµ + ∂φ/∂xµ
by a change of gauge without altering the intrinsic state of the world.
It was explained at the beginning of § 74 that we can make the same
change of the electromagnetic potential without altering the resulting
electromagnetic field.
We accordingly accept this identification. The κµ and Fµν of the
present geometrical theory will be the electromagnetic potential and
force of Chapter VI. It will be best to suspend the convention κ
µ
µ = 0
(74.1) for the present, since that would commit us prematurely to a
particular gauge-system.
It must be borne in mind that by this identification the electromagnetic force becomes expressed in some natural unit whose relation
to the c.g.s. system is at present unknown. For example the constant of proportionality in (77.7) may be altered. Fµν is not altered by
any change of gauge-system (85.6) so that its value is a pure number.
The question then arises, How many volts per centimetre correspond
to Fµν = 1 in any given coordinate-system? The problem is a difficult
one, but we shall give a rough and rather dubious estimate in § 102.
I do not think that our subsequent discussion will add anything
material to the present argument in favour of the electromagnetic in-
ch. vii gauge-invariance 343
terpretation of κµ. The case rests entirely on the apparently significant
fact, that on removing an artificial restriction in Riemannian geometry,
we have just the right number of variables at our disposal which are
necessary for a physical description of the world.
86. Gauge-invariance.
It will be useful to discover tensors and invariants which, besides
possessing their characteristic properties with regard to transformations
of coordinates, are unaltered by any transformation of gauge-system.
These will be called in-tensors and in-invariants.
There are other tensors or invariants which merely become multiplied by a power of λ, when the gauge is altered. These will be called
co-tensors and co-invariants.
Change of gauge is a generalisation of change of unit in physical
equations, the unit being no longer a constant but an arbitrary function
of position. We have only one unit to consider—the unit of interval.
Coordinates are merely identification-numbers and have no reference to
our unit, so that a displacement dxµ is an in-vector. It should be noticed
that if we change the unit-mesh of a rectangular coordinate-system
from one mile to one kilometre, we make a change of coordinates not
a change of gauge. The distinction is more obvious when coordinates
other than Cartesian are used. The most confusing case is that of
Galilean coordinates, for then the special values of the gµν fix the length
of side of unit mesh as equal to the unit of interval; and it is not easy
to keep in mind that the displacement between two corners of the mesh
is the number 1, whilst the interval between them is 1 kilometre.
According to (85.6) the electromagnetic force Fµν is an in-tensor.
Fµν is only a co-tensor, and FµνF
µν a co-invariant.

tensor.
We shall generally indicate by a star (∗

corresponding expressions in Riemannian geometry in order to be independent of (or covariant with) the gauge-system. The following illustrates the general method of procedure.

is a cotensor. The different associated tensors are not equally fundamental in
Weyl’s geometry, since only one of them can be an in-tensor.

This will be an in-tensor since the starred symbols are all independent of the gauge; and it will be evident when we reach (87.4) that the
generalisation has not destroyed the ordinary tensor properties.
We consider the first two terms; the complete expression can then
be obtained at any stage by interchanging ν and σ and subtracting.

88. The in-invariants of a region.
There are no functions of the gµν and κµ at a point which are ininvariants; but functions which are in-invariant-densities may be found
as follows—
∗The unit of κµ is arbitrary; and in the generalised theory in Part II the κµ
there employed corresponds to twice the κµ of these formulae. This must be borne
in mind in comparing, for example, (87.5) and (94.3).
ch. vii the in-invariants of a region 348
Since √

(
∗Bµνσρ)αβ be the second co-covariant derivative
of the co-tensor ∗Bµνσρ; the spur formed by raising three suffixes and
contracting will vary as λ
−4 and give an in-invariant-density on multiplication by √
−g. There are three different spurs, according to the
pairing of the suffixes, but I believe that there are relations between
them so that they give only one independent expression. The simplest
of them is

If A stands for any in-invariant-density,
Z
A dτ
taken over a four-dimensional region is a pure number independent of
coordinate-system and gauge-system. Such a number denotes a property of the region which is absolute in the widest sense of the word;
and it seems likely that one or more of these numerical invariants of
the region must stand in a simple relation to all the physical quantities
which measure the more general properties of the world. The simplest
operation which we can perform on a regional invariant appears to be
that of Hamiltonian differentiation, and a particular importance will
therefore be attached to the tensors hA/hgµν, hA/hκµ.
ch. vii the in-invariants of a region 349
It has been pointed out by Weyl that it is only in a four-dimensional
world that a simple set of regional in-invariants of this kind exists.
In an odd number of dimensions there are none; in two dimensions
there is one, ∗G
√
−g; in six or eight dimensions the in-invariants are
all very complex involving derivatives of at least the fourth order or
else obviously artificial. This may give some sort of reason for the four
dimensions of the world. The argument appears to be that a world
with an odd number of dimensions could contain nothing absolute,
which would be unthinkable.
These conclusions are somewhat modified by the existence of a particularly simple regional in-invariant, which seems to have been generally overlooked because it is not of the type which investigators have
generally studied. The quantity
Z p
−|∗Gµν| dτ (88.4)
is an invariant by (81.1) and it contains nothing which depends on the
gauge. It is not more irrational than the other in-invariants since these
contain √
−g. We shall find later that it is closely analogous to the
metrical volume and the electromagnetic volume (§ 81) of the region.
It will be called the generalised volume. This in-invariant would still
exist if the world had an odd number of dimensions.
It may be remarked that F
µν√
−g, or F
µν, is an in-tensor-density.
Thus the factor √
−g should always be associated with the contravariant tensor, if the formulae are to have their full physical significance.
The electromagnetic action-density should be written

ch. vii the natural gauge 350
The field is thus characterised by an intensity Fµν or a quantity of density F
µν; both descriptions are then independent of the gauge-system
used.
89. The natural gauge.
For the most part the laws of mechanics investigated in Chapters
III–V have been expressed by tensor equations but not in-tensor equations. Hence they can only hold when a particular gauge-system is
used, and will cease to be true if a transformation of gauge-system is
made. The gauge-system for which our previous work is valid (if it
is valid) is called the natural gauge; it stands in somewhat the same
position with respect to a general gauge as Galilean coordinates stand
with respect to general coordinates.
Just as we have generalised the equations of physics originally found
for Galilean coordinates, so we could generalise the equations for the
natural gauge by substituting the corresponding in-tensor equations
applicable to any gauge. But before doing so, we stop to ask whether
anything would be gained by this generalisation. There is not much
object in generalising the Galilean formulae, so long as Galilean coordinates are available; we required the general formulae because we
discovered that there are regions of the world where no Galilean coordinates exist. Similarly we shall only need the in-tensor equations of
mechanics if there are regions where no natural gauge exists; that is to
say, if no gauge-system can be found for which Einstein’s formulae are
accurately true. It was, I think, the original idea of Weyl’s theory that
electromagnetic fields were such regions, where accordingly in-tensor
equations would be essential.
There is in any case a significant difference between Einstein’s generalisation of Galilean geometry and Weyl’s generalisation of Riemannian
ch. vii the natural gauge 351
geometry. We have proved directly that the condition which renders
Galilean coordinates impossible must manifest itself to us as a gravitational field of force. That is the meaning of a field of force according to
the definition of force. But we cannot prove that the break-down of the
natural gauge would manifest itself as an electromagnetic field; we have
merely speculated that the world-condition measured by the vector κµ
which appears in the in-tensor equations may be the origin of electrical manifestations in addition to causing the failure of Riemannian
geometry.
Accepting the original view of Weyl’s theory, the ambiguity in the
comparison of lengths at a distance has hitherto only shown itself in
practical experiments by the electromagnetic phenomena supposed to
be dependent on it but not (so far as we can see) immediately implied
by it. This is not surprising when we attempt to estimate the order of
magnitude of the ambiguity. Taking formula (84.4), dl/l =
1
2
Fνσ dSνσ
,
we might perhaps expect that dl/l would be comparable with unity, if
the electromagnetic force Fνσ were comparable with that at the surface of an electron, 4 · 1018 volts per cm., and the side of the circuit
were comparable with the radius of curvature of space. Thus for ordinary experiments dl/l would be far below the limits of experimental
detection. Accordingly we can have a gauge-system specified by the
transfer of material standards which is for all practical purposes unambiguous, and yet contains that minute theoretical ambiguity which
is only of practical consequence on account of its side-manifestation
as the cause of electrical phenomena. The gauge-system employed in
practice is the natural gauge-system to which our previous mechanical
formulae apply—or rather, since the practical gauge-system is slightly
ambiguous and the theoretical formulae are presumably exact, the natural gauge is an exact gauge with which all practical gauges agree to
an approximation sufficient for all observable mechanical and metrical
ch. vii the natural gauge 352
phenomena.
According to Weyl the natural gauge is determined by the condition
∗G = 4λ, (89.1)
where λ is a constant everywhere.
This attempt to reconcile a theoretical ambiguity of our system
of measurement with its well-known practical efficiency seems to be
tenable, though perhaps a little overstrained. But an alternative view
is possible. This states that—
Comparison of lengths at different places is an unambiguous procedure having nothing to do with parallel displacement of a vector.
The practical operation of transferring a measuring-scale from one
place to another is not to be confounded with the transfer by parallel
displacement of the vector representing the displacement between its
two extremities. If this is correct Einstein’s Riemannian geometry, in
which each interval has a unique length, must be accepted as exact;
the ambiguity of transfer by parallel displacement does not affect his
work. No attempt is to be made to apply Weyl’s geometry as a Natural
Geometry; it refers to a different subject of discussion.
Prof. Weyl himself has come to prefer the second alternative. He
draws a useful distinction between magnitudes which are determined
by persistence (Beharrung) and by adjustment (Einstellung); and concludes that the dimensions of material objects are determined by adjustment. The size of an electron is determined by adjustment in proportion to the radius of curvature of the world, and not by persistence of
anything in its past history. This is the view taken in § 66, and we have
seen that it has great value in affording an explanation of Einstein’s law
of gravitation.
The generalised theory of Part II leads almost inevitably to the
second alternative. The first form of the theory has died rather from
ch. vii the natural gauge 353
inanition than by direct disproof; it ceases to offer temptation when
the problem is approached from a broader point of view. It now seems
an unnecessary speculation to introduce small ambiguities of lengthcomparisons too small to be practically detected, merely to afford the
satisfaction of geometrising the vector κµ which has more important
manifestations.
The new view entirely alters the status of Weyl’s theory. Indeed it is
no longer a hypothesis, but a graphical representation of the facts, and
its value lies in the insight suggested by this graphical representation.
We need not now hesitate for a moment over the identification of the
electromagnetic potential with the geometrical vector κµ; the geometrical vector is the potential because that is the way in which we choose to
represent the potential graphically. We take a conceptual space obeying Weyl’s geometry and represent in it the gravitational potential by
the gµν for that space and the electromagnetic potential by the κµ for
that space. We find that all other quantities concerned in physics are
now represented by more or less simple geometrical magnitudes in that
space, and the whole picture enables us to grasp in a comprehensive
way the relations of physical quantities, and more particularly those
reactions in which both electromagnetic and mechanical variables are
involved. Parallel displacement of a vector in this space is a definite
operation, and may in certain cases have an immediate physical interpretation; thus when an uncharged particle moves freely in a geodesic
its velocity-vector is carried along by parallel displacement (33.4); but
when a material measuring-rod is moved the operation is not one of
parallel displacement, and must be described in different geometrical
terms, which have reference to the natural gauging-equation (89.1).
When in Part II we substitute a conceptual space with still more
general geometry, we shall not need to regard it as in opposition to
the present discussion. We may learn more from a different graphical
ch. vii the natural gauge 354
picture of what is going on; but we shall not have to abandon anything
which we can perceive clearly in the first picture.
We consider now the gauging-equation ∗G = 4λ assumed by Weyl.
It is probably the one which most naturally suggests itself. Suppose
that we have adopted initially some other gauge in which ∗G is not
constant. ∗G is a co-invariant such that when the measure of interval
is changed in the ratio µ,
∗G changes in the ratio µ
−2
. Hence we can
obtain a new gauge in which ∗G becomes constant by transforming the
measure of the interval in the ratio ∗G− 1
2 .
By (87.6) the gauging-equation is equivalent to
G − 6κ
α
α + 6κακ
α = 4λ. (89.2)
But by (54.72) the proper-density of matter is
ρ0 =

8π
(G − 4λ)
=
3

(κ

For empty space, or for space containing free electromagnetic fields
without electrons, ρ0 = 0, so that
κ
α
α = κακ

, (89.4)
except within an electron. This condition should replace the equation
κ
α
α = 0 which was formerly introduced in order to make the electromagnetic potential determinate (74.1).
We cannot conceive of any kind of measurement with clocks, scales,
moving particles or light-waves being made inside an electron, so that
any gauge employed in such a region must be purely theoretical having
ch. vii weyl’s action-principle 355
no significance in terms of practical measurement. For the sake of continuity we define the natural gauge in this region by the same equation
∗G = 4λ; it is as suitable as any other. Inside the electron κ
α
α will
not be equal to κακ
α and the difference will determine the mass of the
electron in accordance with (89.3). But it will be understood that this
application of (89.3) is merely conventional; although it appears to refer to experimental quantities, the conditions are such that it ceases to
be possible for the experiments to be made by any conceivable device.

Weyl himself states that his action-principle is probably not realised
in nature exactly in this form. But the procedure is instructive as

one school of thought.

If the hypothesis (90.2) is correct, these must vanish. The vanishing of (90.51) shows that the whole energy-tensor consists of the
electromagnetic energy-tensor together with another term, which must
presumably be identified with the material energy-tensor attributable
to the binding forces of the electrons∗

found (89.3) having regard to the limitation κ
µ
µ = 0.
∗
I doubt if this is the right interpretation. See the end of § 100.

The result (90.62) becomes by (90.71)

This shows that matter cannot be constituted without electric charge
and current. But since the density of matter is always positive, the
electric charge-and-current inside an electron must be a spacelike vector, the square of its length being negative. It would seem to follow
that the electron cannot be built up of elementary electrostatic charges
but resolves itself into something more akin to magnetic charges.
It will be noticed that the result (90.72) is inconsistent with the
formula κακ
α = κ
α
α which we have found for empty space (89.4). The
explanation is afforded by (90.71) which requires that a charge-andcurrent vector must exist wherever κµ exists, so that no space is really
empty. On Weyl’s hypothesis κ
α
α = 0 is the condition which holds in
all circumstances; whilst the additional condition κ
α
α = κακ
α holding
in empty space reduces to the condition expressed by J
α = 0. It is
supposed that outside what is ordinarily considered to be the boundary
of the electron there is a small charge and current 3

extending as
far as the electromagnetic potential extends.
For an isolated electron at rest in Galilean coordinates κ4 = e/r,
so that κακ
α = e

. On integrating throughout infinite space the
result is apparently infinite; but taking account of the finite radius of
space, the result is of order e
2R. By (90.62) this represents the part of
the (negative) mass of the electron∗ which is not concentrated within
the nucleus. The actual mass was found in § 80 to be of order e
2/a
∗This must not be confused with mass of the energy of the electromagnetic
field. The present discussion relates to invariant mass to which the field contributes
nothing.
ch. vii weyl’s action-principle 359
where a is the radius of the nucleus. The two masses e
2R and e
2/a
are not immediately comparable since they are expressed in different
units, the connection being made by Weyl’s constant β whose value
is left undecided. But since they differ in dimensions of length, they
would presumably become comparable if the natural unit of length
were adopted, viz. the radius of the world; in that case e
2/a is at least
1036 times e
2R, so that the portion of the mass outside the nucleus is
quite insignificant.
The action-principle here followed out is obviously speculative.
Whether the results are such as to encourage belief in this or some
similar law, or whether they tend to dispose of it by something like a
reductio ad absurdum, I will leave to the judgment of the reader. There
are, however, two points which seem to call for special notice—

it is rather a mystery how the second can be contained in the first, since
they seem to be anything but homologous. The connection is simplified by observing that the difference between them occurs in hA/hgµν
(90.51) accompanied only by a term which would presumably be insensible except inside the electrons.
But the connection though reduced to simpler terms is not in any
way explained by Weyl’s action-principle. It is obvious that his action
as it stands has no deep significance; it is a mere stringing together of
two in-invariants of different forms. To subtract FµνF
µν from ∗G2
is
a fantastic procedure which has no more theoretical justification than
subtracting E
ν
µ
from T
ν
µ
. At the most we can only regard the assumed
ch. vii parallel displacement 360
form of action A as a step towards some more natural combination of
electromagnetic and gravitational variables.
(2) For the first term of the action, ∗G2√
−g was chosen instead of
the simpler ∗G
√
−g, because the latter is not an in-invariant-density and
cannot be regarded as a measure of any absolute property of the region.
It is interesting to trace how this improvement leads to the appearance
of the term δ(−2λ
√
−g) in (90.3), so that the cosmical curvature-term
in the expression for the energy-tensor now appears quite naturally
and inevitably. We may contrast this with the variation of G
√
−g
worked out in § 60, where no such term appears. In attributing more
fundamental importance to the in-invariant ∗G2√
−g than to the coinvariant ∗G
√
−g, Weyl’s theory makes an undoubted advance towards
the truth.
Part II. Generalised Theory
91. Parallel displacement.
Let an infinitesimal displacement Aµ at the point P (coordinates, xµ) be carried by parallel displacement to a point P
0
(coordinates, xµ + dxµ) infinitely near to P. The most general possible
continuous formula for the change of Aµ
is of the form
dAµ = −Γ
µ
ναA
α
dxν, (91.1)
where Γµ
να, which is not assumed to be a tensor, represents 64 arbitrary
coefficients. Both Aα and dxν are infinitesimals, so that there is no
need to insert any terms of higher order.
We are going to build the theory afresh starting from this notion
of infinitesimal parallel displacement; and by so doing we arrive at a
generalisation even wider than that of Weyl. Our fundamental axiom
ch. vii parallel displacement 361
is that parallel displacement has some significance in regard to the
ultimate structure of the world—it does not much matter what significance. The idea is that out of the whole group of displacements
radiating from P
0
, we can select one Aµ + dAµ which has some kind of
equivalence to the displacement Aµ at P. We do not define the nature of
this equivalence, except that it shall have reference to the part played
by Aµ
in the relation-structure which underlies the world of physics.
Notice that—
(1) This equivalence is only supposed to exist in the limit when P
and P
0 are infinitely near together. For more distant points equivalence
can in general only be approximate, and gradually becomes indeterminate as the distance is increased. It can be made determinate by specifying a particular route of connection, in which case the equivalence is
traced step by step along the route.
(2) The equivalence is not supposed to exist between any worldrelations other than displacements. Hitherto we have applied parallel
displacement to any tensor, but in this theory we only use it for displacements.
(3) It is not assumed that there is any complete observational test
of equivalence. This is rather a difficult point which will be better appreciated later. The idea is that the scheme of equivalence need not
be determinate observationally, and may have permissible transformations; just as the scheme of coordinate-reckoning is not determinate
observationally and is subject to transformations.
Let P P1 represent the displacement Aµ = δxµ which on parallel
displacement to P
0 becomes P
0P
0
1
; then by (91.1) the difference of coordinates of P
0
1
and P1 is
A
µ + dAµ = δxµ − Γ

ch. vii displacement round an infinitesimal circuit 362
so that the coordinates of P

relative to P are

Interchanging the two displacements, i.e. displacing P P0 along P P1 we
shall not arrive at the same point P

1 unless
Γ

να = Γµ

When (91.3) is satisfied we have the parallelogram law, that if a displacement AB is equivalent to CD, then AC is equivalent to BD.
This is the necessary condition for what is called affine geometry.
It is adopted by Weyl and other writers; but J. A. Schouten in a purely
geometrical investigation has dispensed with it. I shall adopt it here.
All questions of the fundamental axioms of a science are difficult.
In general we have to start somewhat above the fundamental plane and
develop the theory backwards towards fundamentals as well as forwards
to results. I shall defer until § 98 the examination of how far the axiom of parallel displacement and the condition of affine geometry are
essential in translating the properties of a relation-structure into mathematical expression; and I proceed at once to develop the consequences
of the specification here introduced.
By the symmetry condition the number of independent Γµ
να is reduced to 40, variable from point to point of space. They are descriptive
of the relation-structure of the world, and should contain all that is relevant to physics. Our immediate problem is to show how the more
familiar variables of physics can be extracted from this crude material.

we have no gµν. If we wish at this stage to form an invariant of a

which is accordingly more elementary than the other regional invariants
enumerated in § 88.
It may be asked whether there is any other way of obtaining tensors,
besides the consideration of parallel displacement round a closed circuit.
I think not; because unless our succession of displacements takes us back
to the starting-point, we are left with initial and final displacements at
a distance, between which no comparability exists.
The equation (92.55) does not prove immediately that Fµν is the curl

93. Introduction of a metric.
Up to this point the interval ds between two points has not appeared
in our theory. It will be remembered that the interval is the length of
the corresponding displacement, and we have to consider how a length
(an invariant) is to be assigned to a displacement dxµ (a contravariant
in-vector). In this section we shall assign it by the convention
ds2 = gµν dxµ dxν. (93.11)
Here gµν must be a tensor, in order that the interval may be an invariant; but the tensor is chosen by us arbitrarily.
The adoption of a particular tensor gµν is equivalent to assigning a
particular gauge-system—a system by which a unique measure is assigned to the interval between every two points. In Weyl’s theory, a
gauge-system is partly physical and partly conventional; lengths in different directions but at the same point are supposed to be compared
by experimental (optical) methods; but lengths at different points are
not supposed to be comparable by physical methods (transfer of clocks
and rods) and the unit of length at each point is laid down by a convention. I think that this hybrid definition of length is undesirable, and
that length should be treated as a purely conventional or else a purely
physical conception. In the present section we treat it as a purely conventional invariant whose properties we wish to discuss, so that length
as here defined is not anything which has to be consistent with ordinary
physical tests. Later on we shall consider how gµν must be chosen in
order that conventional length may obey the recognised physical tests
and thereby become physical length; but at present the tensor gµν is
unrestricted.

Without any loss of generality, we may take gµν to be a symmetrical
tensor, since any antisymmetrical part would drop out on multiplication
by dxµ dxν and would be meaningless in (93.11).

95. The natural gauge of the world.
We now introduce the natural gauge of the world. The tensor gµν,
which has hitherto been arbitrary, must be chosen so that the lengths
of displacements agree with the lengths determined by measurements
made with material and optical appliances. Any apparatus used to
measure the world is itself part of the world, so that the natural gauge
represents the world as self-gauging. This can only mean that the
tensor gµν which defines the natural gauge is not extraneous, but is a
tensor already contained in the world-geometry. Only one such tensor
of the second rank has been found, viz. ∗Gµν. Hence natural length is
given by
l
2 =
∗GµνA
µA
ν
.
The antisymmetrical part drops out, giving
l
2 = RµνA
µA
ν
.
Accordingly by (93.12) we must take
λgµν = Rµν, (95.1)
ch. vii the natural gauge of the world 373
introducing a universal constant λ, in order to remain free to use the
centimetre instead of the natural unit of length whose ratio to familiar
standards is unknown.
The manner in which the tensor Rµν is transferred via material
structure to the measurements made with material structure, has been
discussed in § 66. We have to replace the tensor Gµν used in that
section by its more general form Rµν, since Gµν is not an in-tensor and
has no definite value until after the gauging-equation (95.1) has been
laid down. The gist of the argument is as follows—
First adopt any arbitrary conventional gauge which has no relation
to physical measures. Let the displacement Aµ
represent the radius in
a given direction of some specified unit of material structure—e.g. an
average electron, an average oxygen atom, a drop of water containing
1020 molecules at temperature of maximum density. Aµ
is determined
by laws which are in the main unknown to us. But just as we can
often determine the results of unknown physical laws by the method
of dimensions, after surveying the physical constants which can enter
into the results, so we can determine the condition satisfied by Aµ by
surveying the world-tensors at our disposal. This method indicates that
the condition is
RµνA
µA
ν = constant. (95.11)
If now we begin to make measures of the world, using the radius of such
a material structure as unit, we are thereby adopting a gauge-system
in which the length l of the radius is unity, i.e.
1 = l
2 = gµνA
µA
ν
. (95.12)
By comparing (95.11) and (95.12) it follows that gµν must be a constant
multiple of Rµν; accordingly we obtain (95.1)∗
.
∗Note that the isotropy of the material unit or of the electron is not necessarily
ch. vii the natural gauge of the world 374
Besides making comparisons with material units, we can also compare the lengths of displacements by optical devices. We must show
that these comparisons will also fit into the gauge-system (95.1). The
light-pulse diverging from a point of space-time occupies a unique conical locus. This locus exists independently of gauge and coordinate
systems, and there must therefore be an in-tensor equation defining it.
The only in-tensor equation giving a cone of the second degree is
Rµν dxµ dxν = 0. (95.21)
Comparing this with Einstein’s formula for the light-cone
ds2 = gµν dxµ dxν = 0. (95.22)
We see that again
Rµν = λgµν. (95.23)
Note however that the optical comparison is less stringent than the
material comparison; because (95.21) and (95.22) would be consistent if
λ were a function of position, whereas the material comparisons require
that it shall be a universal constant. That is why Weyl’s theory of
gauge-transformation occupies a position intermediate between pure
mathematics and physics. He admits the physical comparison of length
by optical methods, so that his gauge-transformations are limited to
those which do not infringe (95.23); but he does not recognise physical
comparison of length by material transfer, and consequently he takes
λ to be a function fixed by arbitrary convention and not necessarily a
constant. There is thus both a physical and a conventional element in
his “length.”
a symmetry of form but an independence of orientation. Thus a metre-rule has
the required isotropy because it has (conventionally) the same length however it is
orientated.
ch. vii the natural gauge of the world 375
A hybrid gauge, even if illogical, may be useful in some problems,
particularly if we are describing the electromagnetic field without reference to matter, or preparatory to the introduction of matter. Even
without matter the electromagnetic field is self-gauging to the extent
of (95.23), λ being a function of position; so that we can gauge our
tensors to this extent without tackling the problem of matter. Many
of Weyl’s in-tensors and in-invariants are not invariant for the unlimited gauge-transformations of the generalised theory, but they become
determinate if optical gauging alone is employed; whereas the ordinary
invariant or tensor is only determinate in virtue of relations to material
standards. In particular F
µν is not a complete in-tensor-density, but it
has a self-contained absolute meaning, because it measures the electromagnetic field and at the same time electromagnetic fields (light-waves)
suffice to gauge it. It may be contrasted with F
µν which can only be
gauged by material standards; F
µν has an absolute meaning, but the
meaning is not self-contained. For this reason problems will arise for
which Weyl’s more limited gauge-transformations are specially appropriate; and we regard the generalised theory as supplementing without
superseding his theory.
Adopting the natural gauge of the world, we describe its condition
by two tensors gµν and Kσ
µν. If the latter vanishes we recognise nothing
but gµν, i.e. pure metric. Now metric is the one characteristic of space.
I refer, of course, to the conception of space in physics and in everyday
life—the mathematician can attribute to his space whatever properties
he wishes. If Kσ
µν does not vanish, then there is something else present
not recognised as a property of pure space; it must therefore be attributed to a “thing∗
.” Thus if there is no “thing” present, i.e. if space
∗An electromagnetic field is a “thing”; a gravitational field is not, Einstein’s
theory having shown that it is nothing more than the manifestation of the metric.
ch. vii the principle of identification 376
is quite empty, Kσ
µν = 0, and by (94.61) Rµν reduces to Gµν. In empty
space the gauging-equation becomes accordingly
Gµν = λgµν, (95.3)
which is the law of gravitation (37.4). The gauging-equation is an alias
of the law of gravitation.
We see by (66.2) that the natural unit of length (λ = 1) is
1/
√
3 times the radius of curvature of the world in any direction
in empty space. We do not know its value, but it must obviously be
very large.
One reservation must be made with regard to the definition of empty
space by the condition Kσ
µν = 0. It is possible that we do not recognise Kσ
µν by any physical experiment, but only certain combinations
of its components. In that case definite values of Kσ
µν would not be
recognised as constituting a “thing,” if the recognisable combinations
of its components vanished; just as finite values of κµ do not constitute
an electromagnetic field, if the curl vanishes. This does not affect the
validity of (95.3), because any breach of this equation is capable of being recognised by physical experiment, and therefore would be brought
about by a combination of components of Kσ
µν which had a physical
significance.
96. The principle of identification.
In §§ 91–93 we have developed a pure geometry, which is intended
to be descriptive of the relation-structure of the world. The relationstructure presents itself in our experience as a physical world consisting
of space, time and things. The transition from the geometrical description to the physical description can only be made by identifying the
tensors which measure physical quantities with tensors occurring in
ch. vii the principle of identification 377
the pure geometry; and we must proceed by inquiring first what experimental properties the physical tensor possesses, and then seeking a
geometrical tensor which possesses these properties by virtue of mathematical identities.
If we can do this completely, we shall have constructed out of the
primitive relation-structure a world of entities which behave in the same
way and obey the same laws as the quantities recognised in physical
experiments. Physical theory can scarcely go further than this. How
the mind has cognisance of these quantities, and how it has woven them
into its vivid picture of a perceptual world, is a problem of psychology
rather than of physics.
The first step in our transition from mathematics to physics is the
identification of the geometrical tensor Rµν with the physical tensor gµν
giving the metric of physical space and time. Since the metric is the
only property of space and time recognised in physics, we may be said
to have identified space and time in terms of relation-structure. We
have next to identify “things,” and the physical description of “things”
falls under three heads.
(1) The energy-tensor T
ν
µ
comprises the energy momentum and
stress in unit volume. This has the property of conservation (T
ν
µ
)ν = 0,
which enables us to make the identification
−8πTν
µ = G
ν
µ −
1
2
g
ν
µ
(G − 2λ), (96.1)
satisfying the condition of conservation identically. Here λ might be any
constant; but if we add the usual convention that the zero-condition
from which energy, momentum and stress are to be reckoned is that
of empty space (not containing electromagnetic fields), we obtain the
condition for empty space by equating (96.1) to zero, viz.
Gµν = λgµν,
ch. vii the principle of identification 378
so that λ must be the same constant as in (95.3).
(2) The electromagnetic force-tensor Fµν has the property that it
fulfils the first half of Maxwell’s equations
∂Fµν
∂xσ
+
∂Fνσ
∂xµ
+
∂Fσµ
∂xν
= 0. (96.2)
This will be an identity if Fµν is the curl of any covariant vector; we
accordingly identify it with the in-tensor already called Fµν in anticipation, which we have seen is the curl of a vector κµ (94.62).
(3) The electric charge-and-current vector J
µ has the property of
conservation of electric charge, viz.
J
µ
µ = 0.
The divergence of J
µ will vanish identically if J
µ
is itself the divergence
of any antisymmetrical contravariant tensor. Accordingly we make the
identification
J
µ = F
µν
ν
, (96.3)
a formula which satisfies the remaining half of Maxwell’s equations.
The correctness of these identifications should be checked by examining whether the physical tensors thus defined have all the properties
which experiment requires us to attribute to them. There is, however,
only one further general physical law, which is not implicit in these
definitions, viz. the law of mechanical force of an electromagnetic field.
We can only show in an imperfect way that our tensors will conform to
this law, because a complete proof would require more knowledge as to
the structure of an electron; but the discussion of § 80 shows that the
law follows in a very plausible way.
In identifying “things” we have not limited ourselves to in-tensors,
because the “things” discussed in physics are in physical space and time
ch. vii the bifurcation of geometry and electrodynamics 379
and therefore presuppose the natural gauge-system. The laws of conservation and Maxwell’s equations, which we have used for identifying
“things,” would not hold true in an arbitrary gauge-system.
No doubt alternative identifications would be conceivable. For example, Fµν might be identified with the curl of λµ
∗
instead of the curl
of κµ. That would leave the fundamental in-tensor apparently doing
nothing to justify its existence. We have chosen the most obvious identifications, and it seems reasonable to adhere to them, unless a crucial
test can be devised which shows them to be untenable. In any case,
with the material at our disposal the number of possible identifications
is very limited.
97. The bifurcation of geometry and electrodynamics.
The fundamental in-tensor ∗Gµν breaks up into a symmetrical
part Rµν and an antisymmetrical part Fµν. The former is λgµν, or if
the natural unit of length (λ = 1) is used, it is simply gµν. We have
then
∗Gµν = gµν + Fµν,
showing at once how the field or aether contains two characteristics,
the gravitational potential (or the metric) and the electromagnetic
force. These are connected in the most simple possible way in the
tensor descriptive of underlying relation-structure; and we see in a general way the reason for this inevitable bifurcation into symmetrical
∗The curl of λµ is not an in-tensor, but there is no obvious reason why as intensor should be required. If magnetic flux were measured in practice by comparison
with that of a magneton transferred from point to point, as a length is measured by
transfer of a scale, then an in-tensor would be needed. But that is not the actual
procedure.
ch. vii general relation-structure 380
and antisymmetrical—geometrical-mechanical and electromagnetic—
characteristics.
Einstein approaches these two tensors from the physical side, having recognised their existence in observational phenomena. We here
approach them from the deductive side endeavouring to show as completely as possible that they must exist for almost any kind of underlying structure. We confirm his assumption that the interval ds2
is
an absolute quantity, for it is our in-invariant Rµν dxµ dxν; we further
confirm the well-known property of Fµν that it is the curl of a vector.
We not only justify the assumption that natural geometry is Riemannian geometry and not the ultra-Riemannian geometry of Weyl,
but we can show a reason why the quadratic formula for the interval is
necessary. The only simple absolute quantity relating to two points is
∗Gµν dxµ dxν.
To obtain another in-invariant we should have to proceed to an expression like
∗B
ρ
µνσ
∗B
σ
λτ ρ dxµ dxν dxλ dxτ .
Although the latter quartic expression does theoretically express some
absolute property associated with the two points, it can scarcely be
expected that we shall come across it in physical exploration of the
world so immediately as the former quadratic expression.
It is the new insight gained on these points which is the chief advantage of the generalised theory.
98. General relation-structure.
We proceed to examine more minutely the conceptions on which
the fundamental axioms of parallel displacement and affine geometry
depend.
ch. vii general relation-structure 381
The fundamental basis of all things must presumably have structure
and substance. We cannot describe substance; we can only give a name
to it. Any attempt to do more than give a name leads at once to an
attribution of structure. But structure can be described to some extent;
and when reduced to ultimate terms it appears to resolve itself into a
complex of relations. And further these relations cannot be entirely
devoid of comparability; for if nothing in the world is comparable with
anything else, all parts of it are alike in their unlikeness, and there
cannot be even the rudiments of a structure.
The axiom of parallel displacement is the expression of this comparability, and the comparability postulated seems to be almost the
minimum conceivable. Only relations which are close together, i.e. interlocked in the relation-structure, are supposed to be comparable, and
the conception of equivalence is applied only to one type of relation.
This comparable relation is called displacement. By representing this
relation graphically we obtain the idea of location in space; the reason
why it is natural for us to represent this particular relation graphically
does not fall within the scope of physics.
Thus our axiom of parallel displacement is the geometrical garb
of a principle which may be called “the comparability of proximate
relations.”
There is a certain hiatus in the arguments of the relativity theory
which has never been thoroughly explored. We refer all phenomena to
a system of coordinates; but do not explain how a system of coordinates (a method of numbering events for identification) is to be found
in the first instance. It may be asked, What does it matter how it is
found, since the coordinate-system fortunately is entirely arbitrary in
the relativity theory? But the arbitrariness of the coordinate-system is
limited. We may apply any continuous transformation; but our theory
does not contemplate a discontinuous transformation of coordinates,
ch. vii general relation-structure 382
such as would correspond to a re-shuffling of the points of the continuum. There is something corresponding to an order of enumeration of
the points which we desire to preserve, when we limit the changes of
coordinates to continuous transformations.
It seems clear that this order which we feel it necessary to preserve must be a structural order of the points, i.e. an order determined
by their mutual relations in the world-structure. Otherwise the tensors which represent structural features, and have therefore a possible
physical significance, will become discontinuous with respect to the coordinate description of the world. So far as I know the only attempt to
derive a coordinate order from a postulated structural relation is that
of Robb∗
; this appears to be successful in the case of the “special” theory of relativity, but the investigation is very laborious. In the general
theory it is difficult to discern any method of attacking the problem. It
is by no means obvious that the interlocking of relations would necessarily be such as to determine an order reducible to the kind of order
presumed in coordinate enumeration. I can throw no light on this question. It is necessary to admit that there is something of a jump from the
recognition of a comparable relation called displacement to the assumption that the ordering of points by this relation is homologous with the
ordering postulated when the displacement is represented graphically
by a coordinate difference dxµ.
The hiatus probably indicates something more than a temporary
weakness of the rigorous deduction. It means that space and time
are only approximate conceptions, which must ultimately give way to
a more general conception of the ordering of events in nature not expressible in terms of a four-fold coordinate-system. It is in this direction
∗The Absolute Relations of Time and Space (Camb. Univ. Press). He uses the
relation of “before and after.”
ch. vii general relation-structure 383
that some physicists hope to find a solution of the contradictions of the
quantum theory. It is a fallacy to think that the conception of location
in space-time based on the observation of large-scale phenomena can
be applied unmodified to the happenings which involve only a small
number of quanta. Assuming that this is the right solution it is useless to look for any means of introducing quantum phenomena into the
later formulae of our theory; these phenomena have been excluded at
the outset by the adoption of a coordinate frame of reference.
The relation of displacement between point-events and the relation
of “equivalence” between displacements form parts of one idea, which
are only separated for convenience of mathematical manipulation. That
the relation of displacement between A and B amounts to such-andsuch a quantity conveys no absolute meaning; but that the relation of
displacement between A and B is “equivalent” to the relation of displacement between C and D is (or at any rate may be) an absolute
assertion. Thus four points is the minimum number for which an assertion of absolute structural relation can be made. The ultimate elements
of structure are thus four-point elements. By adopting the condition of
affine geometry (91.3), I have limited the possible assertion with regard
to a four-point element to the statement that the four points do, or do
not, form a parallelogram. The defence of affine geometry thus rests
on the not unplausible view that four-point elements are recognised to
be differentiated from one another by a single character, viz. that they
are or are not of a particular kind which is conventionally named parallelogramical. Then the analysis of the parallelogram property into a
double equivalence of AB to CD and AC to BD, is merely a definition
of what is meant by the equivalence of displacements.
I do not lay overmuch stress on this justification of affine geometry.
It may well happen that four-point elements are differentiated by what
might be called trapezoidal characters in which the pairs of sides are
ch. vii the tensor ∗B
µνσ 384
not commutable; so that we could distinguish an element ABCD trapezoidal with respect to AB, CD from one trapezoidal with respect to
AC, BD. I am quite prepared to believe that the affine condition may
not always be fulfilled—giving rise to new phenomena not included in
this theory. But it is probably best in aiming at the widest generality
to make the generalisation in successive steps, and explore each step
before ascending to the next.
In reference to the difficulties encountered in the most general description of relation-structure, the possibility may be borne in mind
that in physics we have not to deal with individual relations but with
statistical averages; and the simplifications adopted may have become
possible because of the averaging.
99. The tensor ∗B
µνσ.
Besides furnishing the two tensors gµν and Fµν of which Einstein
has made good use, our investigation has dragged up from below a
certain amount of apparently useless lumber. We have obtained the full
tensor ∗B
µνσ which has not been used except in the contracted form—
that is to say certain components have been ignored entirely, and others
have not been considered individually but as sums. Until the problem
of electron-structure is more advanced it is premature to reject finally
any material which could conceivably be relevant; although at present
there is no special reason for anticipating that the full tensor will be
helpful in constructing electrons.
Accordingly in the present state of knowledge the tensor ∗B
µνσ cannot be considered to be a physical quantity; it contains a physical
quantity ∗Gµν. Two states of the world which are described by different
∗B
µνσ but the same ∗Gµν are so far as we know identical states; just as
two configurations of events described by different coordinates but the
ch. vii the tensor ∗B
µνσ 385
same intervals are identical configurations. If this is so, the Γµ
να must
be capable of other transformations besides coordinate transformations
without altering anything in the physical condition of the world.
Correspondingly the tensor Kσ
µν can take any one of an infinite series
of values without altering the physical state of the world. It would
perhaps be possible to show that among these values is gµνκ
σ
, which
gives Weyl’s geometry; but I am not sure that it necessarily follows.
It has been suggested that the occurrence of non-physical quantities
in the present theory is a drawback, and that Weyl’s geometry which
contains precisely the observed number of “degrees of freedom” of the
world has the advantage. For some purposes that may be so, but not
for the problems which we are now considering. In order to discuss why
the structure of the world is such that the observed phenomena appear,
we must necessarily compare it with other structures of a more general
type; that involves the consideration of “non-physical” quantities which
exist in the hypothetical comparison-worlds, but are not of a physical
nature because they do not exist in the actual world. If we refuse to
consider any condition which is conceivable but not actual, we cannot
account for the actual; we can only prescribe it dogmatically.
As an illustration of what is gained by the broader standpoint, we
may consider the question why the field is described by exactly 14 potentials. Our former explanation attributed this to the occurrence of
14 variables in the most general type of geometry. We now see that this
is fallacious and that a natural generalisation of Riemannian geometry
admits 40 variables; and no doubt the number could be extended. The
real reason for the 14 potentials is because, even admitting a geometry
with 40 variables, the fundamental in-tensor of the second rank has
14 variables; and it is the in-tensor (a measure of the physical state of
the world) not the world-geometry (an arbitrary graphical representation of it) which determines the phenomena.
ch. vii general properties of world-invariants 386
The “lumber” which we have found can do no harm, If it does not
affect the structure of electrons or quanta, then we cannot be aware of
it because we are unprovided with appliances for detecting it, if it does
affect their structure then it is just as well to have discovered it. The
important thing is to keep it out of problems to which it is irrelevant,
and this is easy since ∗Gµν extracts the gold from the dross. It is quite
unnecessary to specialise the possible relation-structure of the world in
such a way that the useless variables have the fixed value zero; that
loses sight of the interesting result that the world will go on just the
same if they are not zero.
We see that two points of view may be taken—
(1) Only those things exist (in the physical meaning of the word)
which could be detected by conceivable experiments.
(2) We are only aware of a selection of the things which exist (in an
extended meaning of the word), the selection being determined by the
nature of the apparatus available for exploring nature.
Both principles are valuable in their respective spheres. In the earlier part of this book the first has been specially useful in purging
physics from metaphysical conceptions. But when we are inquiring
why the structure of the world is such that just gµν and κµ appear and
nothing else, we cannot ignore the fact that no structure of the world
could make anything else appear if we had no cognizance of the appliances necessary for detecting it. Therefore there is no need to insert,
and puzzle over the cause of, special limitations on the world-structure,
intended to eliminate everything which physics is unable to determine.
The world-structure is clearly not the place in which the limitations
arise.

100. Dynamical consequences of the general properties of
world-invariants.
We shall apply the method of § 61 to world-invariants containing
the electromagnetic variables. Let K be a scalar-density which is a
function of gµν, Fµν, κµ, and their derivatives up to any order, so that
for a given region
Z
K dτ is an invariant.
It would have been possible to express Fµν in terms of the derivatives
of κµ; but in this investigation we keep it separate, because special
attention will be directed to the case in which K does not contain the κµ
themselves but only their curl, so that it depends on gµν and Fµν only.
By partial integration we obtain as in § 61

Now suppose that the δgµν and δκµ arise solely from arbitrary variations δxα of the coordinate-system in accordance with the laws of transformation of tensors and vectors. The invariant will not be affected, so
that its variation vanishes. By the same process as in obtaining (61.3)
we find that the change of δκµ, for a comparison of points having the

It has already become plain that anything recognised in physics as
an energy-tensor must be of the nature of a Hamiltonian derivative of
some invariant with respect to gµν; and the property of conservation
has been shown to depend on this fact. We now see that the general
theory of invariants also predicts the type of the reaction of any such
derived tensor to the electromagnetic field, viz. that its conservation is
disturbed by a ponderomotive force of the type FµνHνσ

∗This definition of electric charge through the mechanical effects experienced
by charged bodies corresponds exactly to the definition employed in practice. Our

corresponded to a measure of the strength of the
singularity in the electromagnetic field.
ch. vii general properties of world-invariants 390
which is the general equation given in (82.2). It follows without any
further specialisation that electric charge must be conserved (J
µ
µ = 0).
The foregoing investigation shows that the antisymmetric part of the
principal world-tensor will manifest itself in our experience by producing the effects of a force. This force will act on a certain stream-vector
(in the manner that electromagnetic force acts on a charge and current); and further this stream-vector represents the flow of something
permanently conserved. The existence of electricity and the qualitative
nature of electrical phenomena are thus predicted.
In considering the results of substituting a particular function for K,
it has to be remembered that the equation (100.42) is an identity. We
shall not obtain from it any fresh law connecting gµν and κµ. The final
result after making the substitutions will probably be quite puerile and
unworthy of the powerful general method employed. The interest lies
not in the identity itself but in the general process of which it is the
result. We have seen reason to believe that the process of Hamiltonian differentiation is actually the process of creation of the perceptual
world around us, so that in this investigation we are discovering the
laws of physics by examining the mode in which the physical world is
created. The identities expressing these laws may be trivial from the
mathematical point of view when separated from the context; but the
present mode of derivation gives the clue to their significance in our
experience as fundamental laws of nature∗
.
To agree with Maxwell’s theory it is necessary to have Hµν =

The quantity Rµν can be expressed as a function of the variables in
two ways, either by the gauging-equation
Rµν = λgµν
or by the general expressions (87.5) and (94.61). If the first form is
adopted we obtain an identity, which, however, is clearly not the desired
relation of energy.
If we adopt the more general expression some care is required. Presumably K should be an in-invariant-density if it has the fundamental
importance supposed. As written it is not formally in-invariant in our
generalised theory though it is in Weyl’s theory. We can make it ininvariant by writing RµνRµν√
−g in the form
g
µαg
νβRµνRαβ√
−g,
where the g
µν are to have the values for the natural gauge, but in the
in-tensor Rµν the general values for any gauge may be used. The general theory becomes highly complicated, and we shall content ourselves
with the partially generalised expression in Weyl’s theory, which will
sufficiently illustrate the procedure. In this case Rµν = λgµν, but λ is
a variable function of position. Accordingly RµνRµν = 4λ

Comparing with (90.1) we see that K is equivalent to the action adopted
by Weyl.
This appears to throw light on the meaning of the combination
of ∗G2 with FµνF
µν which we have recognised in (90.1) as having an
important significance. It is the degenerate form in Weyl’s gauge of
the natural combination ∗Gµν
∗Gνµ. The alternation of the suffixes is
primarily adopted as a trick to obtain the required sign, but is perhaps
justifiable.
If this view of the origin of (90.1) is correct, the constant α must
be equal to 4. Accordingly β = 1/2λ, and by (90.51) the whole energytensor and the electromagnetic energy-tensor are reduced to the same
units in the expressions
E
µν
, 8πλT µν
. (100.7)
The numerical results obtainable from this conclusion will be discussed
in § 102.
In the discussion of § 90 it was assumed that P
µν (= hK/hgµν)
vanished. I do not think there is any good reason for introducing an
arbitrary action-principle of this kind, and it seems more likely that
P
µν will be a non-vanishing energy-tensor.
This seems to leave a superfluity of energy-tensors, because owing to
the non-vanishing coefficient Qµ we have the term (κ

g

)
in (90.51) which has to play some rˆole. In § 90 this was supposed
to be the material energy-tensor, but I am inclined to think that it
has another interpretation. In order to liberate material energy we
must relax the binding forces of the electrons, allowing them to expand.
Suppose that we make a small virtual change of this kind. In addition
to the material energy liberated by the process there will be another
consequential change in the energy of the region. The electron furnishes
the standard of length, so that all the gravitational energy will now

have to be re-gauged. It seems likely that the function of the term
(κ

) is to provide for this change. If so, nothing hinders
us from identifying P
µν with the true material energy-tensor.
101. The generalised volume.
Admitting that ∗Gµν is the building-material with which we have
to construct the physical world, let us examine what are the simplest
invariants that can be formed from it. The meaning of “simple” is
ambiguous, and depends to some extent on our outlook. I take the
order of simplicity to be the order in which the quantities appear in
building the physical world from the material ∗Gµν. Before introducing
the process of gauging by which we obtain the gµν, and later (by a
rather intricate use of determinants) the g
µν, we can form in-invariants
belonging respectively to a one-dimensional, a two-dimensional and a
four-dimensional domain.
(1) For a line-element (dx)
µ
, the simplest in-invariant is
∗Gµν (dx)
µ
(dx)
ν
, (101.11)
which appears physically as the square of the length.
(2) For a surface-element dSµν, the simplest in-invariant is
∗Gµν dSµν
, (101.12)
which appears physically as the flux of electromagnetic force. It may
be remarked that this invariant, although formally pertaining to the
surface-element, is actually a property of the bounding circuit only.
(3) For a volume-element dτ , the simplest in-invariant is
V =
q
−|∗Gµν| dτ, (101.13)
ch. vii the generalised volume 394
which has been called the generalised volume, but has not yet received
a physical interpretation.
We shall first calculate |
∗Gµν| for Galilean coordinates. Since
∗Gµν = λgµν + Fµν
we have on inserting the Galilean values

The relation of the absolute unit of electromagnetic force (which is
here being used) to the practical unit is not yet known, but it seems
likely that the fields used in laboratory experiments correspond to small
values of Fµν

Thus if the generalised volume is the fundamental in-invariant from
which the dynamical laws arise, we may expect that our approximate
experimental laws will pertain to the invariant ∗Gµν
∗Gµν√
−g dτ , which
is a close approximation to it except in very intense electromagnetic
fields.
In (100.5) we took K = ∗Gµν
∗Gνµ. The alternation of the suffixes
seems to be essential if hK/hgµν is to represent the material energy (or
to be zero according to Weyl’s action-principle). If we do not alternate
the suffixes the Hamiltonian derivative contains the whole energy-tensor
plus the electromagnetic energy-tensor, whereas we must naturally attach more significance to the difference of these two tensors. It may,
however, be noted that

(variations of κµ being ignored except in so far as they affect Fµν). It
would seem therefore that the invariant K previously discussed arises
from V by the process of ignoration of the coordinates κµ. Equation (101.33) represents exactly the usual procedure for obtaining the
modified Lagrangian function in dynamics.
If this view is correct, that the invariants which give the ordinary
equations adopted in physics are really approximations to more accurate expressions based on the generalised volume, it becomes possible to
predict the second-order terms which are needed to complete the equations currently used. It will sufficiently illustrate this if we consider the
corrections to Maxwell’s equations suggested by this method.

The effect of the second-order terms is thus to make the aether appear
to have a specific inductive capacity and permeability given by (101.41)
and also to introduce a spurious charge and current given by (101.7).
This revision makes no difference whatever to the propagation of
light. Since √
µK is always unity, the velocity of propagation is unaltered; and no spurious charge or current is produced because S
0 vanishes
when the magnetic and electric forces are at right angles.
It would be interesting if all electric charges could be produced in
this way by the second-order terms of the pure field equations, so that
there would be no need to introduce the extraneous charge and current
(σx, σy, σz, ρ). I think, however, that this is scarcely possible. The total
spurious charge in a three-dimensional region is equal to
Z Z Z (ρ
0 − ρ) dx dy dz = −
Z Z BnS
0
dS by (101.6),
where Bn is the normal magnetic induction across the boundary. This
requires that BnS

in the field of an electron falls off only as the inverse
square. It is scarcely likely that the electron has the distant magnetic
effects that are implied.
It is readily verified that the spurious charge is conserved independently of the true charge.
It has seemed worth while to show in some detail the kind of amendment to Maxwell’s laws which may result from further progress of theory. Perhaps the chief interest lies in the way in which the propagation of electromagnetic waves is preserved entirely unchanged. But the
present proposals are not intended to be definitive.
102. Numerical values.
Our electromagnetic quantities have been expressed in terms of some
absolute unit whose relation to the c.g.s. system has hitherto been
ch. vii numerical values 399
unknown. It seems probable that we are now in a position to make
this unit more definite because we have found expressions believed to
be physically significant in which the whole energy-tensor and electromagnetic energy-tensor occur in unforced combination. Thus according
to (100.6) Weyl’s constant α in § 90 is 4, so that β = 1/2λ. Accordingly
in (90.51) we have the combination
8πT µν −
1
λ
E
µν
,
which can scarcely be significant unless it represents the difference of
the two tensors reduced to a common unit. It appears therefore that
in an electromagnetic field we must have

,
where E
µν is expressed in terms of the natural unit involved in Fµν.
The underlying hypothesis is that in ∗Gµν the metrical and electrical
variables occur in their natural combination.
The constant λ, which determines the radius of curvature of the
world, is unknown; but since our knowledge of the stellar universe extends nearly to 1025 cm., we shall adopt
λ = 10−50 cm.−2
.
It may be much smaller.
Consider an electrostatic field of 1500 volts per cm., or 5 electrostatic units. The density of the energy is 52/8π or practically 1 erg per
cubic cm. The mass is obtained by dividing by the square of the velocity of light, viz. 1.1 · 10−21 gm. We transform this into gravitational
units by remembering that the sun’s mass, 1.99 · 1033 gm., is equivalent
to 1.47 · 105
cm. Hence we find—

The gravitational mass-density T

in terms of the centimetre. The centimetre is not directly concerned as
a gauge since F14 is an in-tensor; but the coordinates have been taken
as Galilean, and accordingly the centimetre is also the width of the unit
mesh.
Hence an electric force of 1500 volts per cm. is expressed in natural
measure by the number 2·10−49 referred to a Galilean coordinate-system
with a centimetre mesh.

(1 light-year = 1018 cm.) at a potential difference of 1 1
2 million volts,
the discrepancy is
δl = 102
· 2 · 10−49
· 103
· 1018 cm.
= 2 · 10−26 cm.
We have already concluded that the length of a rod is not determined
by parallel displacement; but it would clearly be impossible to detect
the discrepancy experimentally if it were so determined.
The value of F14 depends on the unit mesh of the coordinate-system.
If we take a mesh of width 1025 cm. and therefore comparable with the
assumed radius of the world the value must be multiplied by 1050 in
accordance with the law of transformation of a covariant tensor. Hence
referred to this natural mesh-system the natural unit of electric force
is about 75 volts per cm. The result rests on our adopted radius of
space, and the unit may well be less than 75 volts per cm. but can
scarcely be larger. It is puzzling to find that the natural unit is of the
size encountered in laboratory experiments; we should have expected it
to be of the order of the intensity at the boundary of an electron. This
difficulty raises some doubt as to whether we are quite on the right
track.
The result may be put in another form which is less open to doubt.
Imagine the whole spherical world filled with an electric field of about
75 volts per cm. for the time during which a ray of light travels round
the world. The electromagnetic action is expressed by an invariant
which is a pure number independent of gauge and coordinate systems;
and the total amount of action for this case is of the order of magnitude
of the number 1. The natural unit of action is evidently considerably
larger than the quantum. With the radius of the world here used I find
that it is 10115 quanta.
ch. vii conclusion 402
103. Conclusion.
We may now review the general physical results which have been established or rendered plausible in the course of our work. The numbers
in brackets refer to the sections in which the points are discussed.
We offer no explanation of the occurrence of electrons or of quanta;
but in other respects the theory appears to cover fairly adequately the
phenomena of physics. The excluded domain forms a large part of
modern physics, but it is one in which all explanation has apparently
been baffled hitherto. The domain here surveyed covers a system of
natural laws fairly complete in itself and detachable from the excluded
phenomena, although at one point difficulties arise since it comes into
close contact with the problem of the nature of the electron.
We have been engaged in world-building—the construction of a
world which shall operate under the same laws as the natural world
around us. The most fundamental part of the problem falls under two
heads, the building-material and the process of building.
The building-material. There is little satisfaction to the builder in
the mere assemblage of selected material already possessing the properties which will appear in the finished structure. Our desire is to achieve
the purpose with unselected material. In the game of world-building
we lose a point whenever we have to ask for extraordinary material specially prepared for the end in view. Considering the most general kind
of relation-structure which we have been able to imagine—provided always that it is a structure—we have found that there will always exist
as building-material an in-tensor ∗Gµν consisting of symmetrical and
antisymmetrical parts Rµν and Fµν, the latter being the curl of a vector (97, 98). This is all that we shall require for the domain of physics
not excluded above.
The process of building. Here from the nature of the case it is
ch. vii conclusion 403
impossible to avoid trespassing for a moment beyond the bounds of
physics. The world which we have to build from the crude material is
the world of perception, and the process of building must depend on
the nature of the percipient. Many things may be built out of ∗Gµν,
but they will only appear in the perceptual world if the percipient is
interested in them. We cannot exclude the consideration of what kind
of things are likely to appeal to the percipient. The building process
of the mathematical theory must keep step with that process by which
the mind of the percipient endows with vivid qualities certain selected
structural properties of the world. We have found reason to believe
that this creative action of the mind follows closely the mathematical
process of Hamiltonian differentiation of an invariant (64).
In one sense deductive theory is the enemy of experimental physics.
The latter is always striving to settle by crucial tests the nature of the
fundamental things; the former strives to minimise the successes obtained by showing how wide a nature of things is compatible with all
experimental results. We have called on all the evidence available in
an attempt to discover what is the exact invariant whose Hamiltonian
differentiation provides the principal quantities recognised in physics.
It is of great importance to determine it, since on it depend the formulae for the law of gravitation, the mass, energy, and momentum and
other important quantities. It seems impossible to decide this question
without appeal to a perhaps dubious principle of simplicity; and it has
seemed a flaw in the argument that we have not been able to exclude
more definitely the complex alternatives (62). But is it not rather an
unhoped for success for the deductive theory that all the observed consequences follow without requiring an arbitrary selection of a particular
invariant?
We have shown that the physical things created by Hamiltonian
differentiation must in virtue of mathematical identities have certain
ch. vii conclusion 404
properties. When the antisymmetric part Fµν of the in-tensor is not
taken into account, they have the property of conservation or permanence; and it is thus that mass, energy and momentum arise (61).
When Fµν is included, its modifying effect on these mechanical phenomena shows that it will manifest itself after the manner of electric
and magnetic force acting respectively on the charge-component and
current-components of a stream-vector (100). Thus the part played
by Fµν in the phenomena becomes assigned.
All relations of space and time are comprised in the in-invariant
∗Gµν dxµ dxν, which expresses an absolute relation (the interval) between two points with coordinate differences dxµ (97). To understand
why this expresses space and time, we have to examine the principles of
measurement of space and time by material or optical apparatus (95).
It is shown that the conventions of measurement introduce an isotropy
and homogeneity into measured space which need not originally have
any counterpart in the relation-structure which is being surveyed. This
isotropy and homogeneity is exactly expressed by Einstein’s law of gravitation (66).
The transition from the spatio-temporal relation of interval to space
and time as a framework of location is made by choosing a coordinateframe such that the quadratic form ∗Gµν dxµ dxν breaks up into the
sum of four squares (4). It is a property of the world, which we have
had to leave unexplained, that the sign of one of these squares is opposite to that of the other three (9); the coordinate so distinguished
is called time. Since the resolution into four squares can be made in
many ways, the space-time frame is necessarily indeterminate, and the
Lorentz transformation connecting the spaces and times of different
observers is immediately obtained (5). This gives rise to the special
theory of relativity. It is a further consequence that there will exist
a definite speed which is absolute (6); and disturbances of the ten-
ch. vii conclusion 405
sor Fµν (electromagnetic waves) are propagated in vacuum with this
speed (74). The resolution into four squares is usually only possible in
an infinitesimal region so that a world-wide frame of space and time
as strictly defined does not exist. Latitude is, however, given by the
concession that a space-time frame may be used which does not fulfil
the strict definition, observed discrepancies being then attributed to a
field of force (16). Owing to this latitude the space-time frame becomes
entirely indeterminate; any system of coordinates may be described as
a frame of space and time, and no one system can be considered superior since all alike require a field of force to justify them. Hence arises
the general theory of relativity.
The law of gravitation in continuous matter is most directly obtained from the identification of the energy-tensor of matter (54), and
this gives again the law for empty space as a particular case. This mode
of approach is closely connected with the previous deduction of the law
in empty space from the isotropic properties introduced by the processes of measurement, since the components of the energy-tensor are
identified with coefficients of the quadric of curvature (65). To deduce
the field of a particle (38) or the motion of a particle in the field (56),
we have to postulate symmetrical properties of the particle (or average particle); but these arise not from the particle itself but because
it provides the standard of symmetry in measurement (66). It is then
shown that the Newtonian attraction is accounted for (39); as well as
the refinements introduced by Einstein in calculating the perihelion of
Mercury (40) and the deflection of light (41).
It is possible to discuss mechanics without electrodynamics but
scarcely possible to discuss electrodynamics without mechanics. Hence
a certain difficulty arises in our treatment of electricity, because the
natural linking of the two subjects is through the excluded domain of
electron-structure. In practice electric and magnetic forces are defined
ch. vii conclusion 406
through their mechanical effects on charges and currents, and these mechanical effects have been investigated in general terms (100) and with
particular reference to the electron (80). One half of Maxwell’s equations is satisfied because Fµν is the curl of a vector (92), and the other
half amounts to the identification of F
µν
ν with the charge-and-current
vector (73). The electromagnetic energy-tensor as deduced is found to
agree in Galilean coordinates with the classical formulae (77).
Since a field of force is relative to the frame of space-time which
is used, potential energy can no longer be treated on the same footing
with kinetic energy. It is not represented by a tensor (59) and becomes
reduced to an artificial expression appearing in a mathematical mode
of treatment which is no longer regarded as the simplest. Although the
importance of “action” is enhanced on account of its invariance, the
principle of least action loses in status since it is incapable of sufficiently
wide generalisation (60, 63).
In order that material bodies may be on a definite scale of size
there must be a curvature of the world in empty space. Whereas the
differential equations governing the form of the world are plainly indicated, the integrated form is not definitely known since it depends on
the unknown density of distribution of matter. Two forms have been
given (67), Einstein’s involving a large quantity of matter and de Sitter’s a small quantity (69); but whereas in the latter the quantity of
matter is regarded as accidental, in the former it is fixed in accordance
with a definite law (71). This law at present seems mysterious, but
it is perhaps not out of keeping with natural anticipations of future
developments of the theory. On the other hand the evidence of the
spiral nebulae possibly favours de Sitter’s form which dispenses with
the mysterious law (70).
Can the theory of relativity ultimately be extended to account in
the same manner for the phenomena of the excluded domain of physics,
ch. vii conclusion 407
to which the laws of atomicity at present bar the entrance? On the one
hand it would seem an idle exaggeration to claim that the magnificent
conception of Einstein is necessarily the key to all the riddles of the
universe; on the other hand we have no reason to think that all the
consequences of this conception have become apparent in a few short
years. It may be that the laws of atomicity arise only in the presentation
of the world to us, according to some extension of the principles of
identification and of measurement. But it is perhaps as likely that, after
the relativity theory has cleared away to the utmost the superadded
laws which arise solely in our mode of apprehension of the world about
us, there will be left an external world developing under specialised
laws of behaviour.
The physicist who explores nature conducts experiments. He handles material structures, sends rays of light from point to point, marks
coincidences, and performs mathematical operations on the numbers
which he obtains. His result is a physical quantity, which, he believes,
stands for something in the condition of the world. In a sense this is
true, for whatever is actually occurring in the outside world is only accessible to our knowledge in so far as it helps to determine the results
of these experimental operations. But we must not suppose that a law
obeyed by the physical quantity necessarily has its seat in the worldcondition which that quantity “stands for”; its origin may be disclosed
by unravelling the series of operations of which the physical quantity is
the result. Results of measurement are the subject-matter of physics;
and the moral of the theory of relativity is that we can only comprehend
what the physical quantities stand for if we first comprehend what they
are.

On two of these papers received whilst this book was in the press
I may specially comment. Harward’s paper contains a direct proof of
bibliography 412
“the four identities” more elegant than my proof in § 52. The paper of
Eisenhart and Veblen suggests that, instead of basing the geometry of
a continuum on Levi-Civita’s conception of parallel displacement, we
should base it on a specification of continuous tracks in all directions.
This leads to Weyl’s geometry (not the generalisation of Chap. vii,
Part ii). This would seem to be the most logical mode of approach
to Weyl’s theory, revealing clearly that it is essentially an analysis of
physical phenomena as related to a reference-frame consisting of the
tracks of moving particles and light-pulses—two of the most universal methods of practical exploration. Einstein’s theory on the other
hand is an analysis of the phenomena as related to a metrical frame
marked out by transport of material objects. In both theories the
phenomena are studied in relation to certain experimental avenues of
exploration; but the possible existence of such means of exploration,
being (directly or indirectly) a fundamental postulate of these theories,
cannot be further elucidated by them. It is here that the generalised
theory of § 91 adds its contribution, showing that the most general type
of relation-structure yet formulated will necessarily contain within itself
both Einstein’s metric and Weyl’s track-framework
